likely evolved and coalesced over centuries in various cultures of the Middle-East, including Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Mesopotanian, Arabic and other sources before being integrated into a masterful

constitutes in effect a mirror of the Islamic world, a melange composed of the peoples of a myriad of cultures and histories, and of Arabic culture\\'s ability to assimilate these varied strands of influence', ' The bulk of its stories center on the two great cultural centers of gravity in the Islamic world, Baghdad and Iraq on one side and Egypt on the other, and though one finds characters in the stories of Hebrew, Christian, Zoroastrian, Indian, Persian and even Chinese origin, characteristically one sees their conversion to Islam and never vice-versa', \" The organic unity of the incredibly diverse tales and stories of the 1001 Nights lies in their rootedness and constant interplay with the ultimate frame story, that of the vizir's daughter, Scheherezade, the narrator of the extended tales over the one-thousand and one nights, and her perpetually impending death at the hands of her husband, King Shahrayar\", \" Thus the book opens with the account of the visit of the

grief', \" Finally, the vizir's own daughter, Scheherezade, asks her father the vizir to marry her to the King, come what may\", \" Over her father's objection she marries Shahrayar, sleeps with him, and with her expected execution looming, calls for her sister Dunyazade to join them in their last hours before daybreak\", ' Dunyazade then asks Scheherezade to entertain the King and herself with her lively stories, and she does so, so entrancing the King with the beginning tale, cut short in a \"cliff hanger\" pause before its ending, that the King postpones her execution until the next night so that he can hear the continuation of the tale', ' With this \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over her head, Scheherezade then continues in the same way for each of the suceeding thousand nights, so entrancing the King and leaving him desirous of the continuation of the stories, which proliferate endlessly, that her execution is continually deferred', ' THE CRIME FICTION GENREExemplary instances of the crime or murder mystery and suspense thriller genres, associated with Wilkie Collins, Poe and Conan Doyle are found in abundance in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements, such as \"The Three Apples', '\" In that tale, Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid Caliph, comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the dead severed body of a young woman', ' Outraged, Harun gives his vizier, Ja’far, three days to find the culprit or be executed himself ', ' At the end of three days, when Ja’far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer', ' As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman’s husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a certain slave, who had wrongfully taken one of the apples of the title, inadvertantly causing the woman’s murder', ' Harun then gives Ja’far three more days to find the guilty slave', ' When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers at the last minute by chance his daughter has the missing apple, which she obtained from Ja’far’s own slave, Rayhan', 'THE HORROR FICTION GENREThe Arabian Nights tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by jinns, who are superhuman spirits, genies or demons', ' This Nights story alongside many others is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls', ' Another prime example is the story \"The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib,\" in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to Islam', 'THE FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION GENRESeveral stories within the One Thousand and One Nights feature early science fiction elements', ' In \"Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud\", the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets', 'In another 1001 Nights tale in the fantasy genre, \"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist, echoing also elements of Sir Thomas More\\'s \"Utopia', '\" Other Arabian Nights tales depict also Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them', ' FEMINIST NARRATIVE----THE FIRST FEMINIST NARRATIVE IN WORLD LITERATUREIt may seem strange to find early feminist literature within such an Arabic Medieval work expressive of a culture and tradition usually presumed to be the exact opposite of feminist concerns', \" Yet the entire structure of the 1001 Nights is that of Scherezade's courageous use of her magnificent intelligence, depth of feeling, creativity and humanity to not only defer the irrational homicidal violence of a male tyrant, but in the very process to re-educate and acclimatize him to greater tolerance and humane civilization\", ' One story of a feminist bent I particulary enjoyed was that of \"The Tale of Sympathy the Learned', '\" In this tale, a female slave named Sympathy, tested by her master and later the Caliph, demonstrates her knowledge as being far superior to all the greatest scholars in Islam', ' By the end of the tale, she is universally praised for both her loyalty and intelligence and receives for herself and her master wealth and power, rewarded by the Caliph', ' By telling this tale, Sheherazade is offering the King a new ideal about how women can be trustworthy and virtuous servants', ' Sheherazade the narrator herself shares many of the qualities of her protagonist Sympathy', ' She has also studied much about Islamic culture and ideals as the daughter of the Vizir', ' Sheherazade also uses her cleverness to accomplish her goals', ' Sympathy uses knowledge to gain riches for her master and Sheherazade uses knowledge to concoct tales to a tyrant King in order to gain liberation for her people', ' Both women fight through prejudice to achieve some status by the end of their prospective stories', ' Sympathy in some ways is a fictional alter ego of Sheherazade', 'THEMES OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS----FATE &amp; DESTINYA common theme in many Arabian Nights tales is fate and destiny', 'THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS IN WORLD LITERATUREThe influence of the 1001 Nights on World Literature has been and remains profound', ' Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib Mahfouz paid homage to it in their own works', ' Other writers who have been influenced by the Nights include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Goethe, Walter Scott, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal, Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W', '\" Four modern writers who have not only been influenced by The Nights but gone on to develop its themes and techniques further in unique directions deserve special mention and individual attention: JOHN BARTH\\'S \"DUNYAZADIAD\" John Barth is one of America\\'s formost \"Post-Modern\" writers, and in his modern narrative epic \"Dunyaziad\" he upends the classical tale of the 1001 Nights by retelling it from the perspective of Scheherezade\\'s younger sister, Dunyazade', ' In this retelling Scheherezade is able to tell so many enchanting stories not from her native creative genius but because each night a bald, bespectacled, middle-aged genie appears from the future to tell the tales from a book he has already read: \"The Thousand and One Nights', ' ITALO CALVINO\\'S \"INVISIBLE CITIES\" In his work Italo Calvino joins history\\'s caprices with the whimsey of imaginative fancy', ' Like Jorge Luis Borges, whom he admired, his novels and tales often read as allegories on the human capacity to find worlds in words and to reveal the fragility of the human condition and of what we take to be historical or material reality in our lives', '\" In her feminist picaresque \"The Road to Baghdad\" she presents us with a modernized and post-modernized reworking of the Arabian Nights saga, replete with gender-bending, morphing, cross-dressing and transgressive identities that balance her created world on the cutting edge between unreality and surreality', \" Interweaving myth, fact and fiction, Gün creates a fanciful, old-fashioned epic that spans the breadth of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and tells a meandering tale of a woman's travels and travails\", \" The awkward young Huru's adventures begin when her brother abandons her during a journey from Istanbul to Baghdad\", ' By the end of her rambles, when she trades her musical talent for something more valuable, Huru has spent time disguised as a boy and has married a woman; she has seen Persia, Turkey and Syria and traveled through time; she has married a Sultan, borne his son and survived--with help from the spirit world--by her wits and her talent for playing her stone lyre', ' ASSIA DJEBAR\\'S \"A SISTER TO SHEHERAZADE\"Assia Djebar is a renown Algerian writer who was the first Algerian woman admitted to the prestigous Ecole Normale Superieure in France prior to Independence', ' Thereafter she became perhaps the most internationally visible woman writer in the Arab world', ' In her rendering of the material of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" she universalizes the experience of Scheherezade to that of all brides on their wedding nights, mapping the collision of the world of fairy tales with the realities of centuries old traditions and the powers of men and society, dramatizing the timelessness of women\\'s subjugation to realities beyond their control, passing from innocence into experience----that is through the rites of initiation into the timeless Sisterhood of Scherezade', ' A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS AND SPIRITUS MUNDIThe \"Thousand and One Nights\" also significantly influenced the composition of my own work, most notably my contemporary epic Spiritus Mundi', ' In particular, the chapter \"Neptune’s Fury &amp; The Perils of the Sea\" including the embedded novella \"Naval Diaries and Ship’s Logs of Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius (1780-1875)\" reflect the themes and techniques of the 1001 Nights', ' In it we follow the fate of the modern protagonist Sartorius\\' ancestor, Royal Navy Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius as he experiences a realm of fantastic adventure, from participating in the naval battles of Trafalgar and Egypt with Lord Nelson, to shipwreck on the Indian Ocean, his sexual encounter with the sorceress \"Lilith\" or Sir She, and most significantly his confinement in the palace of the \"Sultan of the Sea of Stories\" in which, like Scheherezade, he and his fellows, Billali the aged scholar, Ibn Battuta the Arab world traveller, and Princess Nooaysua, a Scheherezadian heroine, must daily invent and compose a series of stories for the Sultan\\'s pleasure, on pain of death', ' In conclusion, I would recommend to all of you to take the time to read and enjoy the 1001 Nights and lose yourself in its narrative web and spell, as well as taking a look at its modern and post-modern spiritual offspring in the works of John Barth,

in ways that no other writer could even pretend to mimic', ' As Calvino reaches for ever more perspectives, where he eschews limits of decency on occasion as he would eschew a traditional plot, he manages to place the reader in a paradox: how is it that I can recognize how immensely talented and aware Calvino is as a writer, and yet find no ultimately lasting pleasure from his innovative works?I wonder if I could venture a hypothesis', ' Italo Calvino is clearly a master of the writing craft', ' Perhaps, there is no one more skilled at finding and arranging the magical words and phrases he uses to build up an idea or unique concept', ' Yet, while the Truth that he explores in his literature has the appearance of richness, it is actually gilded nothingness', ' The philosophies he taps into seem deep but are really just shallow', ' His god is the God of Literature', ' As a fan of literature, you would think I might subscribe to this sort of thing, but I guess I realize that I am actually looking for a God of Life … and appreciate the ability of great literature to reveal that to me--literature as the magnanimous means rather than the end', ' Calvino will find me continuing to search out his short stories, where his talented writing will not be burdened by higher expectations of genuine meaning and purpose, but I gave his novels a try and both left me far more

about people\", \" Everytime Polo would describe a city, an image would form in my head from places I've been to, it's insane that for each chapter I was able to imagine a city\", '\\xa0 Over 50 cities are imagined by the author, each of them told in a short series of passages that is a page or two (or sometimes a bit more than two pages) long, giving some sort of fascinating hint as to what the city is like with Polo ultimately being unable to truly understand the cities but at least glimpsing their nearly infinite variety and Kublai Khan being unable even to grasp this, not even able to guess where Polo would go next or create a city that Polo had not seen or imagined before', \"\\xa0 In some of the discussions the author's displacement of the time of the story in the past allows him to imagine Marco Polo as a prophet telling the future of cities that are seemingly shapeless like Tokyo and Los Angeles and to make some sly jokes about his own future as a prisoner having his stories recorded by the slightly unreliable author of adventure stories who happens to be in the same cell\", '\\xa0 In some cases, some of the details the author makes have puzzling and humorous resonance the author could not have known about, like his reference to a city where women walk pumas on leashes, which the author may have viewed scenes like the \"Starboy\" music video where the singer walks a

that provoke thoughtful tangents', \"Invisible Cities is my introduction to Calvino outside an abortive reading of If on a winter's night a traveler, and more familiarity with his other writings could

of this one city, and each one of his invisible cities demonstrates one of each of these characteristics', ' I think similarly about characters in my novels, in the sense that I myself have certain characteristics: logical and Western, meditative and Eastern, in love and irresponsible, successful and failing, and so on', ' However, if I grant each of these characteristics to its own character all alone, then I am able to clearly define, name, and categorize each character and I can even relate them to one another', ' It seems to me that Calvino does the same in \"Invisible Cities,\" by

are, and the way he plays with that very dilemma, similarly to Nabokov, is half the fun itself\", \"I found many of the conjurations rather terrifying: Calvino's imagery is lush and potent, and he spares no prying look into the hidden horrors of humanity's misery and godless constructs of oppression and immorality\", 'I quite enjoyed Calvino\\'s gentler novelette, \"The Baron In the Trees\",

by time, space, or physics in the describing of these wonderful and haunting places, as he describes airports, people listening to the radio and riding trains and trams amongst the desert caravan stations and sailing ports of the Mediterranean', ' Calvino touches on themes of individuality, conviviality, environmentalism, death, history, archaeology and probably a whole host more topics that will become apparent to me with a second reading, in ways that linger in the soul', ' Calvino, for the first 5-star novel of my summer', \" It's surreal in the best possible way\", ' It feels like an
