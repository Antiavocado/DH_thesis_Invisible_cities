Dolors,"Theories.One could easily declare that the protagonists of this book are the cities, which are different versions of the same city that doesn’t really exist, only maybe in the writer’s mind. Either Venice or Paris, Calvino’s cities are a trip through imagination to lives never had, doors never opened, people never met.Someone else might appoint the reader as the real protagonist of Calvino’s book for he becomes the traveler who visits these cities mentally, which are nothing else than representations of his current mood, his past experiences and his unverbalized longings. The cities change shape and adapt to the traveler’s desires, they blend together into that tenuous moment between sleep and waking, the split second when dreaming occurs.The interpretation of a third reader might allude to the allegoric meaning of the interludes between the extravagant descriptions of the cities where Marco Polo proves the deceitful nature of language to the Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan through silent gesticulation. The Venetian merchant smuggles moods, states of grace and elegies instead of material riches, maybe as a metaphor to show the Chinese ruler that conquering cities is like accumulating empty shells, a nothingness that lacks cohesion, for their true wealth is to be found in their people, not in the physical space they inhabit. How does one imprison souls?Free style.Truth is I am unable to tell you what this book is about. It’s certainly not about what I wrote above. But maybe it is. Every reader will discover its meaning in the surrealistic patterns of titles and alternating themes that give shape to an unrepeatable skyline, a personal print that will only fit the soul of each traveler.To me, Calvino’s cities represent the deadlock between dreams and reality and the way we connect them in our minds to dominate the pulse of time. Unsought memories carry the heavy load of past experiences, and that burden of nostalgia opens the door to unfulfilled desires that materialize into the tangible futures we will never own. How many lives can the keen observer recreate in his mind? How many times can we alter the past in mental recreation, bring the dead back to life by thinking of them? But remembering doesn’t come face forward, it ambushes you around sideways and oftentimes traps you in a deadly embrace, and the reflected image may replace the original thought. In the end, amidst a labyrinthine maze of canals, ancient Gods of locals and foreigners clinging to the threshold of upside down doors and black-and-white strings attaching relationships between the inhabitants of a spider-web city, I couldn’t resist the allure of Maurilia. This was the city where I could finally put my discombobulated mind at rest. The comfortable safety of its sepia postcards brought me back to the cozy evenings with granny when I had only to concentrate on the invisible map her bonny fingers scratched gently on my back after a tepid day at school. Calvino led me to here and now to type these words that make her precious presence more real than ever. I can even delineate the shape of the sound of her fluttering voice clearly in my head. Hello, Granny. Thank you, Calvino.",2013-06-08 16:31:44,5,en,2013-06-08 16:31:44,6,2013,0.00099,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,528
Henry Avila,"This a litany of cities (55) obviously fictitious, exquisitely described by Marco Polo to the great Mongol emperor Kublai Khan... he is understandably dubious. Imagination flows gently through the words of Marco Polo at the grand royal palace in Beijing, towns nobody seen let alone accept. The renowned traveler enjoys visiting new places some very beautifully chronicled by him these settlements but with a touch of creativity which the mind cannot fathomed, yet amaze, city after city, superb even those floating in the air unreachable to all, others underground the citizens in them oblivious to the rest of the world, those looking up feel jealous the mystery unexplained, walls impregnable, roads which take you away from the towns but never to them, sea ports, inland isolated metropolises alone in the vast deserts, they glitter in the sunshine and fade at night. Strangely though the great khan notices no mention of Venice...You would think the continuous page after page of rather unbelievable cities would get monotonous but this is incorrect, as such allure is never boring. The architecture so fantastic it could not exist on the Earth only in the bottomless mind. People like to hope in something they know is impossible their run- of- the - mill lives are unexciting, needing to be charmed, stimulated, dream about what's over the other side of the hill. This will always be true the stories that take them from the humdrum to the heights are perpetual in fashion, humans strive to arrive in a land of the riddle and try solving the enigma, may this be forever. The author of the book Italo Calvino Cuban born with Italian parents , an unique magnificent writer of the visual who lived in Italy. Both a journalist, short story writer and novelist he engaged in, becoming a master of fantasy as shown here and rich, famous, few could capture its essence better. For the person who wants to escape reality and spend a little time in the what could be, imagination is another way to live at least for a short while...Isn't that enough?",2019-11-10 10:52:56,4,en,2019-11-10 10:52:56,11,2019,0.00077,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,348
John Mauro,"My review of Invisible Cities is published at Before We Go Blog.“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”Invisible Cities is a tour de force from Italo Calvino, the late Italian master of speculative fiction. This uniquely constructed novel is set in the late thirteenth century in the court of Kublai Khan. The Venetian explorer, Marco Polo, captivates the Tartar Emperor with descriptions of the cities from his unprecedented travels. By this time, the Mongol Empire has grown to be the largest that the world has ever seen. In the future, it will be eclipsed only by the British Empire in terms of the land area under its control.The Empire has grown so large that the Great Khan feels like he doesn’t even know his own lands. He only learns about the far-flung cities in and beyond his Empire through the stories of travelers, and the well-traveled and poetically tongued Marco Polo is the greatest explorer and storyteller of them all.Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of wondrous and beautiful cities, cities of passion and desire, cities of memory, cities of light and the sky, trading cities, cities of signs, hidden cities, cities of the dead. The Great Khan is captivated by Marco Polo’s poetic descriptions throughout Invisible Cities.While Marco Polo introduces each city by a different name, it soon becomes apparent that the descriptions are actually different facets of a single city: his beloved hometown of Venice. In this sense, Invisible Cities becomes Italo Calvino’s love letter to Venice.But the scope is much broader than we think. It’s true that each description is a different aspect of Venice. But in Invisible Cities, Marco Polo is really describing all cities the world has ever seen or ever will see. He is describing ancient cities like Babylon, future cities like Los Angeles, and even mythical cities like Atlantis or Utopia. He is describing the universe of all possible cities that could ever exist, now, in the past, in the future, or in some alternate reality.It is hard for me to describe the beauty and nuance of Invisible Cities. Just as Marco Polo describes his hometown in this work, as a reader you will find him describing yours as well. Italo Calvino will lead you to discover new and beautiful facets of urbanity in your own surroundings.",2021-11-19 18:37:57,5,en,2021-11-19 18:37:57,11,2021,0.00079,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,406
Michael Finocchiaro,"This is my favourite Calvino book and the one I always suggest to friends to ask me for an interesting easy read or a start into Calvino's universe. It is hard to write a long review here without giving away the entire story but suffice it to say that it is poetic prose at its best. In a nutshell, Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan the various cities he has been to before his visit to China between 1271 and 1275 CE. Each description is more fanciful and beautiful than the previous and there is a spectacular poetic dénouement.The nearest equivalent in graphic novels for me would be the many melancholy works of Schuitten in Les Cités Obscures series. A total classic and must read.",2016-09-17 18:55:06,5,en,2016-09-17 18:55:06,9,2016,0.00068,0.00011,0.00017,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,125
Seemita,"You landed in my world on a calm, dewy eveningAnd struck was I with a song I was about to sing;A song that lay hidden in the silhouettes of each letterThat protruded from the cover, all poised to embitter.But waited I, patiently, under the light of the mundane day;You see, Mr. Calvino, I had a knack of seeing your way.Fusing the curious with the depth, and peppering them with some humor too;All too often, you had served, a world that was both fictional and true.So, on a fine evening, when all your cities rose, at once, to a noisy chatter,I exited my world and entered yours, as it was now, an urgent matter.Welcome!, said Kublai Khan, The Imperious Chinese Emperor,Even as he kept his gaze fixed at one particular Conjurer.This particular Conjurer bore remote resemblance to the mighty Apollo;Ah! He had his name! ‘Step in.’, said the Venetian, Marco Polo.And so, with his highness Khan, I embarked on a tour of his empire,Ably recounted for us, through the dazzling eyes of his humble sire. While Isidora dyed me old even as my dreams kept fluttering in their youthful room,Anastasia set my desires and memories in a vicious cycle, not knowing who fuels whom;Zora pumped heavy sighs from the womb of forgotten cities,As Mauralia lulled me into a nostalgic film of small felicities.Said Marco Polo, all cities are same – same in desire and dementia, promise and insipidity, joy and remorse,
  “You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.”
I paused to ponder, questioning him aloud about the revelations he just made,But he continued to lead me into more cities, bustling with myths, death and trade.He played with my biases at Baucis where people resided on clouds instead,He suspended my belief in Octavia where the entire city stood running on a net! Hopping Hypatia, Armilla, Beershaba and Leonia, when I stepped into Thekla,Marco Polo held back my hand, ‘Watch out, work is still on this messy land.’
  ”Why the construction is still on?
 I asked a peddler scurrying by,
  “So that its destruction cannot begin.”
 was his curt reply.Walking gingerly in an air of puzzle, I witnessed Olinda and Procopia in a mild jostle,One seemed to hold many cities in her womb and the other kept multiplying her people.I stood there, letting the horses of my thoughts, to run amok these many cities,To gauge what lied beneath this expedition, this mind-boggling imaginative treatise.I opened my mouth to ask but Mr. Calvino, you appeared from nowhere,‘The tour is over!’ is all you said, not paying heed to my nasty stare.Here I am now, jumbling my geography and history, and a bit of memory as wellAnd filling mighty gaps that can serve as a decent rejoinder, I have this to tell - Essential is not the fact whether these cities can be discovered on a map;The essence lies, instead, in hunting for a common stamp.A common stamp that shall impart an identity free of colour and creed,Irrespective of our place of birth, shall bind us with the same deed.Deed bellowing swirls of compassion, industry and honesty sans any chagrin And a city of such deeds doesn’t lie outside but reigns unequivocally within.Trust Mr. Calvino to show you, how subliminal accounting of life appears,Follow Mr. Calvino to receive in your lap, sparkling wishes to last years.Beware of his trap though! Don’t fall for his genius all too much,Oh but this is futile warning, for there is no way to escape his touch.----The tour snippet is here! 
  “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many; accept the inferno and be such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”
Because in my book, both are paragons of imagination.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>",2017-08-23 15:35:58,5,en,2017-08-23 15:35:58,8,2017,0.00635,0.00012,0.00042,0.00019,0.00046,0.00027,706

J.G. Keely,"In writing, pretension is the act of pulling your hamstring while lifting your pen. It is that sudden, clear, and unfortunate. It should also be avoidable, but anyone gifted with a grain of brilliance is tempted to extend it as far as they can, like Donne's speck of dust stretched the length of the universe, one is left wondering whether it was more ludicrous or thought-provoking.Calvino's 'Invisible Cities' is a series of descriptions of mythical, impossible cities told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Each short description is like one of Donne's metaphysical poems: presenting a philosophical argument or idea and then turning it on its head. As an Italian, Calvino drew his inspiration from the same source as Donne: Francesco Petrarch.Petrarch is the innovator of the modern sonnet, the modern love poem, and 'confessional' poetry. However, before you all wish him dead(er), his 'love' and 'confessions' were only the cover for his philosophical explorations. Like Sidney, Shakespeare, Wyatt, and the Victorian poets (Keats, Browning, Byron), the surface of the poem is not the whole story.Also like Petrarch, Calvino's short pieces all work together to create a grander story, using repetition and developing symbols to create webs of meaning from one story to any other. Both Petrarch and Calvino take a narrow view for their collections, one Love and the other Cities, but Petrarch does more with his.Calvino's repetition is sometimes interesting and meaningful, but often, it seems like he's still trying to hash out his ideas. Some of the cities are remarkable and poignant, but others somewhat scattered and redundant.The frame story of Polo and Kublai also vacillates in profundity. At it's best, it questions the nature of human relationships, interaction, understanding, and language barriers. At other times it descends into New Age metaphysics and solipsism: endlessly wondrous, endlessly pointless, and perfect for capturing the imagination of the first-year philosophy major.These moments of overextension are balanced by some truly thought-provoking and delightful observations and questions about the nature of the world and the senses. The book is truly dreamlike, in that one dream may alter the way you look at life, while the next one will be about bass fishing with Julie Newmar in your underwear; fun perhaps, but not lasting.Calvino has a great talent, and a remarkable mind, but it's clear that he was bent on transgressing and ignoring boundaries, and hence often crosses the limits of his own skill. This uninhibited exploration is truly something every author and artists should aspire to, but the false leaps should be left behind in editing.As redundancy and vagueness builds up, we can see the areas of difficulty and obsession for Calvino, for these always end with a shrug instead of the final thrust that carries us over his more salient points. While in these cases he might have made the journey itself the important part, he tends to concentrate on the ends, even when he proves incapable of reaching them.Walking the same roads again and again looking for something and failing to find it is not the mark of the fantastical fabulist, but of the minute realist. Calvino's story is never small and personal, even when detailed and nostalgic, it is hyperbolic and magical.When he dances around some vague point, he is not Ariosto, presenting the limits of mankind: Calvino gives us his own limits. The descriptions are far-flung and often set the mind reeling with humor or more poignant observation. That he sometimes overextends himself is not such a crime, when occasionally, he does reach those heights.It's true to say that this book is not any one thing, that it defies description and draws from many sources and traditions, but neither do these varying and disparate influences coalesce into some wholly new vision. The closer he comes to any climax or conclusion, the more he grows uncertain.I'm not suggesting that such a climax is necessary--indeed, in a loosely-structured work like this, where the most effective aspect is the comparison and contradiction between each individual piece, shoehorning in such a convenient conclusion wouldn't really work--neither Petrarch nor Borges needed one. In their great collections, one could start almost anywhere, and end almost anywhere, without having lost the thread of their thoughts.What frustrates about Calvino is that he's constantly pushing towards conclusion, and harping on it despite the fact that such a conclusion is not even necessary--indeed, a work like this achieves its effect by the questions it asks, not the answers that it tries to give. So, Calvino ends up giving us numerous empty answers when simple silence would have been far more provocative.Is it ever really meaningful to end by stating 'maybe it is this way, maybe it is that way, maybe nothing exists at all'? What do we gain by saying this that we would not have by simply leaving it unsaid? The author who imagines stating that his own ignorance is profound is simply exercising the vanity of false humility.Better to let the observations and moments of wit speak for themselves. If the reader is not reminded of his own short-sightedness by these, then telling him he is short-sighted certainly won't help.I must say that these moments of falling flat could have been a subtlety of William Weaver's translation, but since such an issue is beyond my meager means to fully explore, I felt it better to tender my review to the book I read, rather than to the book that might exist out there, somewhere.",2009-03-17 05:34:54,3,en,2009-03-17 05:34:54,3,2009,0.0141,0.00014,0.00107,0.00022,0.00094,0.00039,909

Calvino and his translator painted vivid pictures of various cities, each a seemingly magical realm with its own quirks. As Marco tells more and more stories, Kublai questions the nature of his empire.Unfortunately, very little actually happens. While they are very well written, the individual city tales read almost like entries in a poet's travel journal. There's not really an actual story unless you consider an ongoing conversation between two historical figures a plot.While I'm glad I read it and I thought the writing was masterful, I don't feel like gushing about this particular book.

Anu,"""What are men to rocks and mountains?""
 - Jane AustenOr should I say, ""What are men to cities and structures?""I finish Invisible Cities as my parents plan their trip to Europe. As someone who loves going to new places and travelling, there is a sense of irony that I feel as I review this. As a 21 year old student with neither the money nor the means to embark on a journey myself, I find myself wandering about the cities that Marco Polo describes to the great Kublai Khan. Invisible Cities is a fairy tale; albeit a fairy tale for adults. Calvino, who was surely high as a kite when he wrote this, describes in this tiny, yet profoundly powerful book, eleven kinds of ""cities"". Cities, they maybe, but they are the cities that we imagine. These are fantastical cities we lose ourselves in all day, everyday. These cities are not cities at all; they are the thoughts we think, the stories we imagine, and the people we think we perceive. Invisible Cities is an ethereal masterpiece that transports us to a world that we would like to see ourselves in, but would perhaps be disappointed to set foot in. It is that single moment of thought right before reality and dreams morph into one another. After all, 
  the descriptions of cities Marco Polo visited had this virtue: you could wander through them in thought, become lost, stop and enjoy the cool air, or run off.
To the people who say that all these cities sound the same, I give you the Great Khan's reasoning: 
  ""Kublai Khan had noticed that Marco Polo's cities resembled one another, as if the passage from one to another involved not a journey but a change of elements. Now, from each city Marco described to him, the Great Khan's mind set out on its own, and after dismantling the city piece by piece, he reconstructed it in other ways, substituting components, shifting them, inverting them.:
I don't think I can do justice to the masterpiece that is Invisible Cities by writing about it myself; I am unworthy. I have, instead collected quotes by some of the world's best writers, quotes that sum up what each of these cities were to me. Memory

Every city is defined by its name, and every city is continuous. Every city is all of these cities; it is what we make it to be, it is how we perceive it. Like Venice.

""When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them. And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.""""To distinguish the other cities' qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice.""

  ""It has neither name nor place. I shall repeat the reason why I was describing it to you: from the number of imaginable cities we must exclude those whose elements are assembled without a connecting thread, an inner rule, a perspective, a discourse. With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear.

Rakhi Dalal,"A city inhabiting one’s inside, its streets, lanes and by-lanes running in the veins and arteries, the hubbub of the city enlivening even the tiniest fraction of a being. The city; living, breathing, growing and leaving an impression in the very essence, even if it is never visited in one’s lifetime. And then - a multitude of such cities, standing under the auspices of their heritage, a witness to the chronicles of their golden times, cities with their halos; an invisible but inescapable allure. Cities; rising with dusk, their pulses throbbing to the rhythm of stars. Cadence of street lights; illuminating in its glow, the stones of the wall of a building standing silently and witnessing bare human emotions/acts – love, passion, deceit, despair, joy, pain, indifference but above all a discreteness embodying the city. Cities, with its uneven alleys where an old man sit outside the door of his house, the wrinkles on his face telling the story of his life, his eyes a testimony of submission in the face of the inevitable, and a young, beautiful woman, selling seasonal flowers by the side; unnerving a quiescent thought. The labyrinthine roads which never seem to end, taking one forward, on and on, with their flow, adding a clutter of houses by the side, a face sneaking from a window; seeming a gateway to the unknown. The outline of houses in the sea by which they stand; the shadows in clear water defying the ephemeral. Cities, with those parks and boulevards where a curious seeker seeks the traces of path trodden by great authors and thinkers; an eagerness to associate with that one idea, a particular thought, capable of creating a summer inside…..

Piyangie,"Invisible Cities is quite a strange book. It chronicles the dialogue between Kublai Khan, the Mongol emperor, and Marco Polo, a Venetian traveler, wherein the latter describes the cities of the empire from his travels to the former. Over 9 chapters, Marco describes 55 cities divided into 11 thematic categories. The 55 cities, all bear female names. But the more cities Marco describes to Kublai Khan, the more he sees a certain resemblance of a pattern until he realizes that Marco Polo has all through described only one city, which is Venice. Outwardly, the book is a beautiful nonsense. All you read is Marco Polo's nonsensical description of the cities to which he had traveled. But if you give more meaning to his words and look beyond their surface, the nonsense clears itself into a thought-provoking philosophy. Marco Polo's descriptions of the cities of his travels may sound abstract and nonsensical until you realize that it must be so, for one can only describe a thing according to his subjective perspective. Marco's descriptions of the cities of his travels are a hybrid of his memories, desires, and what he perceived through his naked eye. But what does he see through his naked eye? Does he see the cities of Kublai Khan's vast empire? Or do the cities elude his vision and become invisible?Kublai Khan's desire to comprehend the present true state of the cities of his great empire is frustrated by Marco's descriptions. When Kublai demands Marco to describe his cities, with the help of a chessboard, only the great Khan comes to realize that what he seeks to comprehend, can never be comprehended. ""Perhaps, instead of racking one’s brain to suggest with the ivory pieces’ scant help visions which were anyway destined to oblivion, it would suffice to play a game according to the rules, and to consider each successive state of the board as one of the countless forms that the system of forms assembles and destroys. Knowledge of the empire was hidden in the pattern drawn by the angular shifts of the knight, by the diagonal, passages opened by the bishop’s incursions, by the lumbering, cautious tread of the king and the humble pawn, by the inexorable ups and downs of every game. What were the true stakes? At checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner’s hand, a black or a white square remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire’s multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness. . . .""The book is a beautiful work of philosophy. I was in awe once the comprehension began to dawn upon me. There was so much material to reflect on. I was thoroughly captivated by his beautiful writing and profound philosophy. My kindle is full of highlighted passages which is evidence in itself of how much I was enchanted by his words. I don't like to crowd my review with quotations, but I feel some of it is called for, in justice for this work. Therefore, I'll be sharing the following two quotations as a winding up to the review. ""Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. “But which is the stone that supports the bridge?” Kublai Khan asks. “The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,” Marco answers, “but by the line of the arch that they form.” Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: “Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.” Polo answers: “Without stones, there is no arch.”""Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms. “On the day when I know all the emblems,” he asked Marco, “shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?” And the Venetian answered: “Sire, do not believe it.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, and don't trust them if they do.Ever since the rapturous reading experience that is If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, I have been hooked on the man's words. As it is with most blossoming relationships, I'm a little wary of coming on too strong or getting too close too quickly and chipping away at the charming veneer of novelty in the throes of my overeager enthusiasm before we've gotten comfortable with each other, but this is the third book of his I've read in a year (exactly a year, actually) and I am just as giddily smitten with Invisible Cities as I was with my aforementioned introduction to Calvino's works and also Cosmicomics. Invisible Cities clocks in at a seemingly stingy 165 pages, with many pages only half-filled and a number of them left conspicuously blank. But since this is a Calvino novel, his beautiful, beautiful words are only a fraction of the payoff: The ideas, the images, the quiet messages, the prophetic warnings disguised as storytelling, the dreamlike quality licking at the edges of every sentence and even the apparent silences of seemingly unused spaces carry more weight than they would if they were crafted by any other writer's hand. And there is not a sentence that does no warrant savoring with a second or third read in this entire book.This novel is what happens when two historical figures -- in this case, an elderly but spirited Kublai Khan and the younger traveler Marco Polo -- whose lone commonality is being alive at the same time try to communicate without sharing a language. Polo conveys the cities (or is it just one city's many faces?) he has seen to the emperor through gestures, objects and other nonverbal cues. Like Cosmicomics, it is a map comprising the essences of things; like If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, the reader becomes part of the narrative as he is welcome to draw his own conclusions just as much as Khan is. I think I've made it pretty clear in previous reviews that I love duality and the play between opposing forces in my reading materials of choice, probably to the point that I find them in places they don't really live. Invisible Cities has 'em by the fistfuls, though. The palpably dynamic tension between the visible and in-, happiness and misery, the imagined and the real, the living and the dead, the storyteller and his audience, the roaring inferno and the heavenly plains, the finite work of creation and infinite motion of ruin, the image and its mirrored reflection was a delight unto itself, but the additional step of blurring the lines between each extreme with every achingly gorgeous stop on the raconteur's journey through recollection and the listener's odyssey of imagination was exactly the kind of extra mile I expect Calvino to traverse with gusto. There is an inversion of expectations that gives each push-and-pull pairing of opposites some of the hazy magic that is so particular to Calvino's works. It's not entirely surprising to read about cities where the living envy the cities of their dead to the point of emulation and confusion as to which populous is really alive, or whose people are more at peace with the certainty of obliteration than their earthbound counterparts because their metropolis is built upon a spider-web network of ropes and they are all too aware that their precarious balance could fail at any moment (is there anyone more alive than those who are reminded of death on a daily basis?). But there is a pleasant surprise when the design of a carpet and the layout of a city are echoes of each other; oracles who are consulted about the mystical connection between two unlikely entities only offer the ambiguous insight that ""[o]ne of the two objects…. has the form the gods gave the starry sky and the orbits in which the worlds revolve; the other is an approximate reflection, like every human creation."" While there are common threads and themes woven throughout Polo's narratives, no two cities (or no two faces of the city) are examined in the same way. The cities' signs, desires, dead, names, skies and other shared traits may be explored but never to the same effect. And sometimes seemingly unrelated characteristics make similar points: A city would have no history without its dead, just as its living have no motivation for progress without acknowledging the mistakes upon which a history was built, just as the dead have a peace that the living won't know without forging ahead in life. There is a sense of concentricity that unites each urban observation, which, along with the interspersed exchanges between emperor and explorer, help move the novel toward its oft-hinted-at augury of urgency that reaches its climax as the stories reach their conclusion, as relevant as it was centuries ago when Marco Polo and Kublai Khan were supposedly having their animated discourse in a garden, as when Invisible Cities was published four decades ago, as when I finished it this morning: The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, and make them endure, give them space.",2013-03-06 11:35:32,5,en,2013-03-06 11:35:32,3,2013,0.0092,0.00013,0.00061,0.0002,0.00054,0.0003,953
Garima,"Since my copy of if on a winter's night a traveler is on its way, I thought of equipping myself with writings of Italo Calvino. In the meanwhile I laid my hands upon Invisible Cities. It’s one of the few books to which I have given 5 stars making it clearly evident as to how much I loved it. This work of Calvino is an unadulterated imagination booksonified. It can best be described as the figment of everybody’s imagination. I hope I can safely say for everyone that once in our lives we have imagined a particular world, a particular life where the existence is on our terms and conditions. We are the sole architect of that world where everything is perfect, imperfect, unreal or simply invisible and only we are allowed to see it or live in it. While reading this book, the memories of my childhood surfaced where I used to imagine a place where everything is made up of chocolates, (well..ok!! I imagine it today also), a little later, I used to imagine of getting a whole new wardrobe every day. At present I imagine of reading Ulysses in one day, Gravity’s Rainbow another day, assimilating every aspect these books offer to their readers. What else!! Yes…writing an International Bestseller novel in a matter of days, winning Booker Prize and getting a chance to meet my all favorite authors and discussing their books. And this one I particularly like...Being the sole survivor when the world ends and starting a whole new civilization the way I want it, where procreation is not the only option of creating a life for human beings (No, I am not a sadist but yes, this book hit me hard in the head). So I hope you got the gist. Imagination is like a ship without a shore and the only option it has is to keep on moving. Keep Reading :)",2012-06-23 20:06:16,5,en,2012-06-23 20:06:16,6,2012,0.00246,0.0001,0.00026,0.00013,0.00023,0.00018,319
Mohsin Maqbool,"THERE are books that you read and forget. And then there are books that you read and they get etched in your mind forever; Italo Calvino’s ‘Invisible Cities’ is one such book.image: Marco Polo the magnificent. Marco Polo visits the imperial palace of Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan and describes to him all the beautiful cities of the world that he has visited. But can these magnificent cities really exist? Are they just a figment of Mr Polo’s imagination? Or is he just describing Venice while stretching his creative powers to the fullest?image: There is something special -- extraordinarily special -- about Venice. You know Mr Calvino is writing about Venice when he says: “In Esmeralda, city of water, a network of canals and a network of streets span and intersect each other. To go from one place to another you have always the choice between land and boat: and since the shortest distance between two points in Esmeralda is not a straight line but a zigzag that ramifies in tortuous optional routes, the ways that open to each passerby are never two, but many, and they increase further for those who alternate a stretch by boat with one on dry land. And so Esmeralda's inhabitants are spared the boredom of following the same streets every day.”image: A gondola ride for those in a romantic mood. And if you can recite a sonnet by Shakespeare, your day is made -- and maybe night too! However, you can definitely make out that it can’t be Venice when he writes: “In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain. From a mountainside, camping with their household goods, Ersilia's refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.” Each chapter starts with a meaningful dialogue between the Chinese emperor and the Italian traveller. Each ends with an extremely clever exchange of words between the two. If Emperor Kublai Khan is wise, then Marco Polo is worldly-wise and street-smart being so well-travelled. The following is an excerpt from the book to help you get an idea:  “Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. ‘But which is the stone that supports the bridge?’ Kublai Khan asks. ‘The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,’ Marco answers, ‘but by the line of the arch that form.’ Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: ‘Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.’ Polo answers: ‘Without stones there is no arch.’” The book is so surrealistic that you often feel that you are dreaming. However, the book is not all visions and dreams. It also mentions real cities from our world. It talks about the environment and how man in his greed to grab more and more land is destroying natural habitats and the grazing ground of cattle and other animals. But Mr Calvino does it in such a way so as not to make you feel bored or disinterested even for a second while going through its contents. The short 150-page book has an extremely unusual cover. It has seven chapters each of which has several sections. The sections could be dealing with ‘Cities and memory, ‘Cities and desire’, ‘Cities and signs’, ‘Thin cities’, etc. You neither have any heroes or villains in the fictitious book nor do you have a plot. Yet the book is as exciting as one can be.image: Italo Calvino photographed at work on his desk. This is the first tome that I have read of Mr Calvino’s and I am feeling absolutely impatient to grab another one. What a tale has the Cuban-born writer woven! As much credit goes to William Weaver for his superb translation. You will enjoy his alliterations to the hilt. Mr Weaver was honoured with the National Book Award Finalist for Translation in 1975. Let me say this before I end my review. This is one book that I am most willing to read again and again as the prose of the book reads like poetry. And beautiful poetry is meant to be read over and over again. If you don’t read this tome, then you will be truly missing something. So please get hold of ‘Invisible Cities’ at the first opportunity you get.image: Film poster of ""Marco Polo the Magnificent"".image: Sixties star Horst Buchholz.  One last piece of information: I have seen only one film made on the travels of Marco Polo called ""Marco Polo the Magnificent"" (1965) in which he embarks on a journey with some relatives, taking him all the way to China. It shows less of his travels and more of his adventures in the land of Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan.  The film starred handsome German actor Horst Buchholz as Marco Polo and Anthony Quinn as Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan.",2016-09-22 19:14:44,5,en,2016-09-22 19:14:44,9,2016,0.00121,0.0001,0.00017,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,879
Megha,"If on a winter's night a traveller were to set out to traverse the garden of forking paths, she could perhaps follow the moon in its flight to catch the sleepwalkers caught in a midsummer night's dream. She could walk east of Eden to see midnight's children appear, only to lose themselves into a frolic of their own. She could turn at a bend in the river to come upon the savage detectives figuring out the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime. She could walk up to the tree of smoke and find the man without qualities waiting for Godot to arrive and hand out copies of a user's manual to life, not realizing that he jests with them indefinitely.She could walk through the tunnel only to find no light at its end. The chirping of the obscene bird of the night could draw her attention to one of the 2666 wells lined with the yellow wallpaper. She could look into it to find herself gazing at the abyss of human illusion and hearing the satanic verses. She could look up to find notes from underground strewn all around. To escape the heart of darkness she could travel south of the border, west of the sun to the land where the sun also rises.She could walk up the magic mountain to take in the breaking dawn and hear the wind sing. Before this moment stretches itself into one hundred years of solitude, she could consult the cloud atlas and find her way to the snow country. She could walk past the glass castle where the pale king sits on the iron throne. She could take a stroll on the cannery row to watch the crowd hypnotized by the enchantress of Florence. As the spell breaks they could each retire to a room of their own where a portrait of the artist adorns the wall and Foucault's pendulum swings to keep time. The window could be looking out to the lighthouse located on the treasure island. Beyond which lies the opposing shore where the setting sun is giving way to the hour of the star. She could be travelling to the end of the gravity's rainbow as the sound of silence wakes her up and interrupts the dream story. In the faint glow of the city lights peeking in through the window, her gaze could fall upon the stacks of the people of paper carrying within themselves the remembrance of the things past and the shape of things to come. Each containing within itself invisible cities - one or many - with ephemeral paths waiting to be traversed. you could wander through them in thought, become lost, stop and enjoy the cool air, or run off.If on a winter's night a traveller..._______________________________Cloned CitiesIt is not the voice that commands the story, it is the ear.Marco Polo takes us on a wondrous journey through the invisible cities that live in his imagination. We pass each of his tales through the refractive prism of our own perception. We create tenuous threads connecting the city to all that we are and all that we have been. We build a whole another invisible city, sculpted in the image of that of Polo’s.

Nandakishore Mridula,"Oh,the city, city... the endless sea...Fun and games on top, mud and filth beneath -A beauty who smiles on the surface; The mistress who wouldn't let you go...
So wrote one of our poets.You live in the city: and slowly, the city starts living in you. It takes on a life of its own in your mind. Once the city gets to you, it won't let you go. (I speak from personal experience. I spent twelve eventful years of my life in Cochin, and I carry that city with me, even here in the Middle East.)Italo Calvino has immortalised the city in this slim volume of fantastical tales, told by Marco Polo to Kubilai Khan. Stories which may be distorted memories, fanciful imaginings or outright lies (Polo was not exactly truthful). There is no story as such. Vignettes of imaginary cities are listed, one after the other, in haphazard fashion, interspersed with conversations between the Khan and Polo. The pieces are absurd and surreal - one feels that if this book would have been illustrated, only Salvador Dali could have been entrusted with the task.There are eleven ""themes"", of a sort:1. Cities and Memory2. Cities and Desire3. Cities and Signs4. Thin Cities5. Trading Cities6. Cities and Eyes7. Cities and Names8. Cities and the Dead9. Cities and the Sky10. Continuous Cities11. Hidden Cities...And five sketches under each, so there is a sort of mathematical precision. The themes are all jumbled together with no semblance of order. (After finishing the book, I made a discovery - one can cover the descriptions of the cities theme-wise, instead of sequentially, and get a totally different take on the book.)Each of these vignettes can be analysed in depth, and dissected using Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian metaphysics: but I will not attempt to do so. It would be spoiling the beauty of the narrative. Each reader can find his or her own meaning in these cities - and most likely, it would be the city buried deep in their psyche which would be talking to them.So my friends, my only request to you is to come and visit these cities. You won't be disappointed.",2015-11-03 11:15:47,4,en,2015-11-03 11:15:47,11,2015,0.00361,0.0001,0.0003,0.00014,0.00029,0.00021,357
Algernon (Darth Anyan),"After sunset, on the terraces of the palace, Marco Polo expounded to the sovereign the results of his missions. As a rule the Great Khan concluded his day savoring these tales with half-closed eyes until his first yawn was the signal for the suite of pages to light the flames that guided the monarch to the Pavilion of August Slumber.But this time Kublai seemed unwilling to give in to the weariness.""Tell me another city!"" he insisted. With Marco Polo cast in the role of Scheherezade and Kublai Khan as Harun Al Rashid, we embark on an enchanted journey through 1001 cities, seeking to capture their unique essence, their secret identity, their pasts and their futures. The great khan is approaching the end of a glorious career, his wars of conquest finished and his dominion extending to the outer margins of the known world. Now he turns his attention inward in an effort to discover what exactly is his empire composed of. For this purpose, he sends his ambassador Marco Polo to all the corners of the realm, to see and to report back on the geography, the arhitecture, the people, the customs and the history of all the cities he passes through. Based on these stories, Kublai Khan dreams of building the perfect city, the sublimation of all the diversity into a sparkling, diamond like structure that would endure for all ages and will form his legacy for future generations.Marco Polo is in his element here, the born explorer who follows his own siren song to find out what lies beyond the horizon, what precious treasure are hidden behind high city walls, still chasing the dream that sent him away for long years from his beloved Venice. Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have. Why call them  invisible  since we spend the whole book discussing the visible? Because Italo Calvino entices us to look beyond appearances, beyond the obvious and the trivial if we want to find the secret that makes each city unique and unforgetable. Each of the visited cities is named with a woman's name, a poet's trick that suggests odalisques dancing seductively behind seven diaphanous veils, needing to be caught by surprise, teased or charmed into finally revealing their inner beauty. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else. Are the cities described in the book real or fantastic? A figment of Marco Polo's imagination that he feeds piecemeal to Kublai Khan as payment for his sojourn at the court? Or are they actual locations that can still be discovered today by the adventure bound tourist? Readers who are already familiar with Italo Calvino know that the poet loves dissimulation of his purposes, puzzles and daring metaphors, so they would patiently wait for the last veil to be lifted, for the final revelation to be brought to light, for the name of the ultimate city to be uttered.Until then, the casual reader can only relax and enjoy the apparently random postcard like prose poems that link stone with emotion, people with stars, the dead with the living. The atlas of the world that is patiently gathered in these pages is etched with sugestive names, symbolic gestures, sights, smells, songs, desires, dreams, memories, cautionary warnings, ""moods, states of grace, elegies"" When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls between the bettors. Cities as bastions against wilderness, civilization versus barbarism, art versus plain existence, the eternal versus the transient, structure and order versus chaos - each and every postcard contains within itself dualities of meaning where every affirmation is countered by a negation, every highlight serves to point at the shadows : the city of the dead reflecting the map of the city above, the city on the ground mirroring the dance of the constellations in the night sky. What line separates the inside from the outside, the rumble of wheels from the howl of the wolves? Read on to learn how one city is like a ""butterfly emerging from a beggared chrysalis"", another is growing in concentric circles like tree trunks which each year add one more ring, how the city where you arrive for the first time is different from the one you leave never to return, even if they bear the same name. Yet another city is described like a game of chess, or compared to an hourglass which is not turned over, with the unborn citizens waiting patiently their turn in the upper bulb, while the dead are settling at the bottom like geological strata. One city would inspire opposite phantasmes in the eye of the beholder: one sailor gazes upon its's domes and sees camel caravans setting off, while the bedouin glimpses tall white towers like sails departing for far off lands. Each city receives its form from the desert it opposes; and so the camel driver and the sailor see Despina, a border city between two deserts. Calvino is not interested in the cold data of statistics and economic trends, angle of arcades or width of boulevards, dates of revolutions or names of famous leaders. He is after the effect of the city on the psyche of its inhabitants, the subjective translation of desire into the language of stone. A description of Zaira as it is today should contain all Zaira's past. The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls. You might be tempted to think that Marco Polo is only spinning tales of long abandoned cities from the past, but I would argue against the theory. Even when talking about histories and ruins and the march of generations, the message is both timeless and timely. The same words would describe any of the cities we are living in today. I found clear references to globalization, corporate monoculture, suburban sprawls, alienation, consumerism and many other woes of the 21st century. Read for yourself and see if you recognize the landscape: In Chloe, a great city, the people who move through the streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another: meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping. Ultimately, every city described in the novel is indeed just another faucet of that gemstone Kublai was wishing for - the eternal, universal, 'invisible' heart of the word 'city' as a simbol of civilization.  Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.  exclaims at one point Marco Polo. This civilization he sees as heading for dissolution, just like the short-lived empire of Kublai Khan, attacked not so much from without as from its own internal weaknesses, a failure of imagination that favors conformity and safety over change and diversity. Yes, the empire is sick, and, what is worse, it is trying to become accustomed to its sores. This is the aim of my explorations: examining the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed, I gauge its short supply. If you want to know how much darkness there is around you, you must sharpen your eyes, peering at the faint lights in the distance. I will put my conclusion in spoiler tags, because it is too beautiful and elegant to be left out, but also too relevant as the solution to the puzzle to be revealed in advance. In a final dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, they dwell on the subject of fictional cities in literature, utopian and dystopian, and on the unavoidable death and destruction waiting for them at the end of the road. The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.",2014-02-23 03:10:58,5,en,2014-02-23 03:10:58,2,2014,0.00099,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,1497
Lisa,"Cities and EyesThere is a world that lies atop a mound of green, where the treetops are tinged with rust and people fly by on bicycles and shoes with wheels. The saunterers wander off the criss-crossed madness of paths and cut up and down hills, across grassy plains, diving into the forested fringes. We are on Mount Royal, the fabled dead volcano visited by schoolchildren on geography trips and tourists searching for a grander view of the city below. The air is crisp up here. Each inch of space is planned, manicured, protected, but the city folk walk about in a daze of wilderness, returning in their minds to the heart of Nature with a capital N. Men in red uniforms clop past on horses, clocking time back another hundred years. Laughter is easy on this smallest of mountains. But as the sun sets, so falls a hush, because no one lives here and all but the most resourceful must climb back down to civilization.Taking a path eastward, down stairs and past picnic tables, breathing in the mild perfume of Mary Jane, we arrive in the heart of the Plateau, the land of balconies and colourful spiralled staircases, each avenue an architectural delight. Chairs scrape on terraces and people in gypsy pants stop to look over the potted herbs and organic produce. From afar you can hear the cries ""Gentrification!"" and ""Ici on parle français!"" but people carry on babbling in whatever language they so choose and spending, spending, spending. Here the parks are filled with strollers and a depanneur is never more than a minute away. Spirits and prices soar, and people walk with a skip in their step, humming a tune that keeps them from looking down at their erstwhile neighbours who can no longer climb the stairs to their apartment.To meet them, we must hold our breath and sink deeper into this underground city. The sun never shines in this commercial belly of the beast. Through tunnels and past shop windows, you can walk the length of downtown without ever feeling the frosty lick of the whipping winter wind. Camped out in dank passageways are huddled shapes, facing the wall, sleeping or waking in this nightmare world. Women walk past quickly and do not recognize their old schoolmate, disfigured by a perfect storm of circumstance. The denizens of this metro station arrive early for work, Tim Hortons cups empty and at the ready, waiting for a drop from the streams of lucre rushing hurriedly past. I look at this city with so many sets of eyes and know that for every image that I capture, there are three million more being imagined every moment. My heart lies in all these places but I cannot show them to you, because I am too busy swimming in the lake of my mind.",2013-09-27 10:38:05,5,en,2013-09-27 10:38:05,9,2013,0.0082,0.00014,0.00047,0.00019,0.00059,0.00038,473

"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye","Hidden Cities * 6 You once asked me to describe Venice, and I told you that, every time I described a city, I was saying something about Venice. That was only partly true. In a way, I told you everything I knew about Venice, and nothing. The truth is that when we first met, I barely knew Venice, its buildings, its canals, its gardens, its squares, its people. Does that surprise you? It shouldn’t. Let me explain why. Do you know how old I was when I first left Venice with my father and uncle? Six! I returned nine years later, and departed again for China within two years. In all, I had just eight years to picture my city. The truth is, I know your city and this garden better than I know my home, if that is what it is. It’s true, I was saying something about Venice. I was defining what it was not. If I could describe cities that were exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions, then I hoped that what would remain would be the rule, the essence, and perhaps that essence would be Venice. If I could describe everything that was impossible, improbable, even too probable, then what would be left would be real, and what was real would be Venice, at least for me. This was my desire. I had no memory to speak of. There was nothing to be nostalgic about. I did not have words. I didn’t have things. I had only images of things. Admittedly, they were childish images in my mind. Besides, they were not many. They were mainly images of our family home: our garden, our kitchen, my bedroom. Little more. I was afraid that, if I put these images into words, I would lose them. I reserved words for everything else. I kept them for things that needed signs. My images of Venice didn’t need signs. They were emblems in their own right. I hoped these images of when I was six or 17 would form a kernel around which my dreams of Venice would grow. As I experienced other cities, as I dreamed of invisible cities, what I learned would not supplant these images. It would grow around them and protect and preserve them. My images would be both contained and concealed. They would be emblems within emblems. In this way, I hoped that my images would not languish, that they would not disintegrate, that they would not disappear. I hoped that I would not forget them.  Most of all, though, I was trying to preserve objects, things. Not words, phrases, metaphors. In the absence of words, I couldn’t utilise language, and if I couldn’t utilise language, I couldn’t communicate with you. For you to know Venice, you would have to see it for yourself, and I knew there was little prospect of your leaving your Court. There was a time when I thought you might wish to visit Venice. If I made it seem alluring, you might desire it. If I made it seem powerful, you might fear it, so much so that you would have to wrestle its power from it. I was relieved when you said, “I have neither desires nor fears.” I preserved Venice from and for you without words. I hoped not to deceive you in doing so. There is no language without deceit. Conversely, there is no deceit without language. Words work by way of distinctions. Words distinguish things from each other. I was trying to describe many cities for your edification. To distinguish these cities’ qualities, it’s true, I had to speak of a first city that would remain implicit. I told you that city was Venice. It had to remain implicit, because I lacked the knowledge or the will or the ability to make it explicit. Instead, I invented cities like Esmeralda and Phyllis that contained canals and boats and barges, so that you could imagine your own Venice. The irony is that you think of Venice more than I do. As fond of it as I am, I try to think of it as little as possible. If I dwelled on it, I’d worry that it would turn into words, and if it turned into words, then, as I’ve said, it might vanish. I wish that Venice didn’t even have a name. It would be so much easier to think of it as pure form, like a philosopher, as absolute truth, beauty, perfection, as the essence of a city, as not just the city of my youth, but the essence of every city. Venice doesn’t need words. I don’t need words for Venice. If I needed anything, I would need only images. And images of Venice await my return.

Pradnya K.,"I live in a city. It's not small, neither big but it's always happening. It's sheltered with huge green trees and the city looks like an emerald. When seasons change, the city changes its colors. It then resembles to red rubies or molten gold. I wish it'd be lapis lazuli once in a year. My city is strange in a way. It's a city I've always dreamt of since childhood when I just knew it by name. Accidentally I stumbled into it and never left. But I feel it hypnotized me, pulled me towards it and never allowed me to leave. I settled in here and except few loved ones I pulled everything I have, in here. My city somehow shows me glimpses of other cities.There's one city I recall vividly, the city of words. The reason it's called so being it always forces me to read. It makes me read; read the slogans on hoardings, the names on banners, the advertisements and signboards of doctors, or a cornered fish merchant. It makes me read a thrown away piece of newspaper sprayed on the table, wrinkled or a calendar of gone by years. It makes me read again and again the old book or a mail sent by old friend who is long forgotten or a scribbled poem in the moment of ecstasy. I know those books, mails, poems by heart now but the city has its powers and it'd force me re-read it anyhow. The last time I went there I kept on reading the signboards of roads, lane numbers and the areas, I only know names of. I wonder where that road will lead, how it will end, will I find a mother waiting for her children at houses there or a restless lovers seeking rendezvous. There's another city I know. It makes me read too but not the words. I read situations there coz nobody there talks to each other. I try decipher the public bus driver when he puts brakes to his vehicle recklessly, halts in the way, drumming fingers on the hood of idling engine. They seem reflection of each other, the idle man and the engine. He darts his eyes around and before he catches me, I look the other ways. I see ladies shopping at the hawkers stall, bargaining and leaving with empty baskets. People stop abruptly in between the road, jamming the lanes and nobody seems to mind it. Every shopkeeper puts prices to his goods as he wishes. The children wander about in front of running vehicles and thugs but nobody cares. I do not like this city but I'm compelled to make trips there, frequently.When I return from that city I don't like things around. So I go to another city which is velvety dark. It's like a black hole, an empty well. Its called city of hidden because it hides everyone inside so even if people are around you don't see them. The voices, even muffled ones, are absorbed by air and you don't hear them. The breeze refuses to carry the scent of sweat trickling on eyebrows of exhausted laborer or a lingering perfume of a posh lady. You feel peace there and instantly the city connects with you. Maybe because the city creates an aura of your mood and isolates you in your own wish. You are encased in what you want, which is desolate and bereft.But there's one city in which I don't live neither do I go to. The city, rather, stays inside me. There's no reading inside this city. Everything is so intrinsic that I don't need to read or listen to it. There is clamor so great that it reveals everything. Naturally its opposition of the city of hidden. There's chaos in air, in sky, in woods and I find it too complex to comprehend. It changes its color before I see it. It shifts its hoarding before I know what was hanging there earlier. It stops abruptly before I realize the stealthy eyes of someone speaking to me. My strange city, where I live, which I dreamt of since childhood travels too and shows me these glimpses but yet it binds me to itself, making me take shelter in its dark green shadows in harsh summer.",2015-09-17 23:37:48,4,en,2015-09-17 23:37:48,9,2015,0.00151,0.00012,0.00025,0.00012,0.0002,0.00017,714
Geoff,"All the spaces we inhabit are in some way our dreams. All the spaces we pass through are composed by our subjective perceptions for us as much as they are composed of the objective material that works on those perceptions. All spaces hold and reflect something of ourselves, our histories. I sit in my carefully arranged room composing this piece on Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities; I am seated in a comfortable chair, it is arranged below a window that lets in copious light in the mornings and afternoons, to better aid my reading and my writing, it is within leg’s reach of my bed, on which I rest my legs, and my laptop sits comfortably on my thighs, and being that my room is a converted attic with walls painted white and few decorations, I enjoy, in pauses between spans of typing, watching the late afternoon light play on the white walls with its brightness and shadows over the angular lines that used to delineate where the roof rose; the ceiling slopes at strong angles, there is a skylight above my bed that I generally keep covered, that during storms resounds with a soothing percussive patter. The only decoration on my walls is a block print of a human heart. It hangs adjacent to the west facing window, which catches light later than the windows behind me, which are south-easterly. Books run along my walls and rest in stacks beside my bed, a record player and stereo are directly to my left, on a kind of shelf, and records and books cascade here and there. This is my space, I have lived in it for years, I have made it mine, it is an outward projection of my interior; I have attempted to make the walls show their stark angles more strikingly by not cluttering them with decoration; I have placed my clothes carefully away and set my possessions in a pleasant order so that there are fewer obstructions to my thinking and motion; my bed is positioned so the south-easterly morning light does not interfere with my sleeping; the lamp is within arm’s reach of the bed; the only picture on my wall is of a heart. This room is as much my interior as my exterior, it suits all of my physical and psychic needs, the form it has taken is a reflection of some pattern determined within my being, almost without my being aware of it. Our exteriors, the things we inhabit and therefore influence and change by our thoughts, efforts, ambitions, are changed in accordance with interior demands, interior desires, interior longings, hopes, etc. It is the same for streets, cities, countries. The interior lives of the inhabitants of these places create the exteriors that they then exist within, shop in, shuffle about, fight, make love, laugh and die in. The physical world is a creation of the conscious and unconscious intentions of the human imagination, an agglomeration of all human hopes, drives, desires, made into a material reality.So everything imaginable is realizable; and whether it is realizable in concrete, in steel, in glass, in brick, in flesh, or whether it is only realizable in images, words, pictures, pixels, is of little difference. A perfectly constructed sentence, a perfectly rendered painting, a perfectly filmed scene, a perfect cascade of musical tones- they are manifest realizations of ideas. All is possible that one can imagine if one can speak it, draw it, compose it. The limitations of the architect, the city-planner, the foreman can be realized by the artist, the writer, the photographer. The human imagination is infinite, and every iteration, every form, is in some way achievable.Calvino’s Invisible Cities is a document of these ideas; it is a proof, in perfectly constructed, astoundingly deep and evocative sentences, that whatever we dream can be and will be fulfilled. That just two souls, sitting in a garden, outside of time and within it, their lips fixed to pipe stems, watching smoke trails’ shifting patterns ascend the sky and exchanging mere words, can invent a universe; and that the universe of the living which is the source and inspiration for their visions can be rendered into symbols that can then supersede, magnify, illuminate, and reorder that living world into something that speaks to and connects very deeply with the hidden currents and vibrations of what it is to be a thinking, desiring, dreaming human being. This is a profound book, one of those rare works where nothing seems missing or superfluous, where every sentence locks into a kind of crystalline totality, an affirmation of the vital importance and sovereignty of works of the imagination.”The catalogue of forms is endless: until every shape has found its city, new cities will continue to be born. When the forms exhaust their variety and come apart, the end of cities begins.”-pg. 139”Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”-pg. 29”’I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others,’ Marco answered. ‘It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operations beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.’”-pg. 69""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension; seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""-pg. 165",2009-07-31 23:23:43,5,en,2009-07-31 23:23:43,7,2009,0.00095,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,1033
Paul,"This is a sort of homage to Marco Polo’s travelogue and consists of Polo describing 55 different cities to Kublai Khan, each city having a woman’s name. It is divided into nine chapters. Each chapter is started and finished with a brief conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. The cities are split into eleven groups of five and each group has a particular theme. There is a particular mathematical structure which has been tabulated and is freely available on the internet if you are so inclined. This isn’t really surprising as Calvino was a member of the Oulipo group. It is also true that as Polo says, all the descriptions of the various cities are really aspects of his own city, Venice. The writing is certainly poetic and beautiful and it is easy to read. It has also had acres of praise from other authors and critics.Here is Gore Vidal:“Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvellous invention like Invisible Cities, perfectly irrelevant.”Jeanette Winterson:“The book I would chose as pillow and plate, alone on a desert island.”Minna Proctor:“Calvino’s fiction isn’t a story; it’s an ordering and reordering of the emotional and philosophical reverberations of our civilized world, our human condition”Here is Calvino himself:“For example, when I began writing Invisible Cities I had only a vague idea of what the frame, the architecture of the book would be. But then, little by little, the design became so important that it carried the entire book; it became the plot of a book that had no plot.”Yes that’s right, there is no plot, there is structure and framework. It has also been turned into an opera …. And a ballet. Calvino does pull together fragments and comments that have resonance and provoke thought:“The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space”“…the people who move through the streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another; meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping… something runs among them, an exchange of glances like lines that connect one figure with another and draw arrows, stars, triangles, until all combinations are used up in a moment, and other characters come on to the scene.”The cities are not all medieval as although this is a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, Calvino is not limited by time and space and his comment that “all of the world’s airports are really the same” may resonate with many. This is a travel book without the travel as the conversations indicate. Inevitably a whole industry of study and analysis has grown around the novel: discussions of Calvino’s notions of nonchronological temporality, applications of Deleuze’s temporal theory to provide a systematic analysis of Calvino’s radical notion of time and I’m not even going to mention synthesizing “the repetition of instants”.I enjoyed the language and the poetic flow of it all, but like some other “classics” I had some misgivings. All the cities are set in the East and they have their fair share of camels, goats, bearded women, naked women of great beauty and various “sideshow” type predictabilities, all named after women and all available for the male gaze, inert. I also had Said’s Orientalism running through my head as well. So, I finished it with some hesitations in my mind, but I’m glad I read it.",2019-10-26 23:23:47,3,en,2019-10-26 23:23:47,10,2019,0.00079,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,676
Darwin8u,"“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” ― Italo Calvino, Invisible CitiesIt was kinda cool to start reading this as I was finishing Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Reading about the historical Khan while sipping from the imagined Khan was a trip. This is a difficult book to get your mind around. At heart, it is a book of architecture, of city planning, of zones. I'm not sure if this book is framed to be a novel filled with poetry, or a poem filled with prose, or both. I think the beauty of it is its ability to float, with a surreal beauty through both the cities of the just and the unjust; through both the history of the fanciful and the prophesies of the certain. Anyway, Calvino illuminates in one book (within the confines of one white square of the chessboard and inside the silent whisper of a comma) the entire potential for man, for cities, and for the novel.",2011-08-04 00:09:31,5,en,2011-08-04 00:09:31,8,2011,0.00091,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,186
Vartika,"In Jeanette Winterson's 
  Sexing the Cherry,
 Fortunata tells Jordan of a city of dancers and acrobats that dealt with disaster by using ropes as roads and walkways; a city without floors that slowly abandoned gravity and eventually floated away. Not since Winterson have I felt what I felt reading 
  Invisible Cities,
—and I picked it up because the back has a quote by her claiming this as 'The book [she] would choose as pillow and plate, alone on a desert island.' In my mind, Winterson's Fortunata is slowly blurring into Calvino's Marco Polo taking his host, the emperor Kublai Khan, on a tour of marvelous cities and metaphysical states through words, gestures, and ideas. I have realised, emerging slowly from the binds of this book—the spell of it—that there is no point attempting to describe its magic; there are no spoilers in this review because nothing can spoil the experience of it. All there is to say is that I loved these invisible cities. I will come back to them time and again.

Bradley,"I think this short fiction is quite beautifully drawn, a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn that consists mostly of one enormous travelogue consisting of cities, their differences, and eventually, only their consistencies and made-made up features.There's nothing much more to it except cities and brief descriptions of each, from ancient all the way to modern cities and even cities magical and purely imaginary. On a few occasions, there's a philosophical discussion about what is perceived in reality and what is expected, of ennui and excitement, of grief and happiness, but in the end, it's all just cities.It's enjoyable for what it is. It's almost purely description in conversation.

Henry Martin,"You past adolescence and enter the world of adult literature. At first, you read anything and everything that found its way to your hands; then, slowly you begin discovering your own, unique literary taste, and you become selective. The more you read, the more selective you become. Your list of favorite authors and genres grows; you find literary voices that speak directly to your soul. By now, you have reached mid age, and you have over two decades of serious reading under your belt. Any new book that you open, any new author that you discover is judged against your favorites, against the voices that stimulated your mind over the years. Words and phrases are judged against those that provided comfort when you felt down; ideas and executions are compared against the benchmarks established over the years. You think you know what you like; you think you know what to expect. Well, perhaps you do. New books come along, and some attempt to quietly sneak in to your consciousness, while others attempt to shatter your world. Most, if not all, pale with your favorites, do not fit with your ideas, or leave you cold. Then, one day, you come across a gently used book. It's small, it looks interesting, and you buy it. That book manages to get under your skin in a very inconspicuous way, without you even noticing. Such was my encounter with Invisible Cities. My first Italo Calvino. He arrived on the heels of Bolaño, Borges, Ungar, and Girondo. Good company, you might say. I say no. Bolaño left me lukewarm—I was expecting more. Borges blew my mind—but only temporarily—he is amazing, but very systematic. Ungar was great—while reading him. Girondo was thought-provoking—entertaining but not mind-altering. Calvino managed to deliver where all of the above failed. He did not force his way to me, he came unsuspected, veiled in beautiful prose. All of the aforementioned authors wrote fine literature, amazing actually. Yet, they were all ""in your face"" at times. Calvino is like a spy who sneaks in under the cover of darkness. And here comes the strangest part: I haven't even noticed. To be honest, I cannot quite describe what kind of book is Invisible Cities. At first, I thought I knew. Then I thought I did not know, then I thought I knew again, and, in the end, I was reminded that I did not know. The book is simply beautiful. It is irrelevant and relevant at the same time, pointless and necessary at other times, while remaining non-contradictory. Does this make sense? I thought so. To me, Invisible Cities is not a single book, but three separate books. The first one is a wonderful study of humanity. These are the cities that reflect human behavior, the cities that serve as metaphor for greed, anger, vanity, et cetera. The second book is a book of cautionary tales. These are the cities that tell a story, a story of what will happen if we, as humans, do not change our ways. The third book is a book of philosophy. These are the cities as metaphors for mortality, actions and consequences, continuity, faith... To this book also belong the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, for these are truly philosophical. Then again, I am probably wrong on all counts. One thing is certain, and that is the undeniable truth that Italo Calvino was an amazing writer. His prose is magical. So now, after more than two decades of reading what I consider to be quality literature, I have to shuffle my mental shelf and make room for Calvino, right next to my all-time favorites where he belongs.",2013-10-04 00:23:46,5,en,2013-10-04 00:23:46,10,2013,0.01072,0.00011,0.00042,0.0002,0.00068,0.00031,611
Bram,"Given the subject matter—um, descriptions of cities—I wasn’t expecting this book to affect me on such a personal, visceral level. But during the final city description and again in Marco Polo’s closing dialogue with Kublai Khan, I got serious chills. And to put that in perspective, I was finishing it outside (90+ degrees) George Bush Intercontinental Houston, or whatever the hell that airport’s called. Now this effect may have been compounded by the fact that I was also listening to the Conan the Barbarian soundtrack. Despite the inarguable greatness of Basil Poledouris’ score, however, I have no doubt that it was this book that ultimately moved me to an epidermal state that has no business budding on a summer day in Texas. It’s that good—a philosophical gem and a gratifying guide for the adventurous mind and wonder-full spirit. It took two or three city descriptions for me to realize that Marco Polo wasn't describing cities so much as the human mind and experience. Rather than take away from the beautiful physicality of the descriptions, however, this gives the book a limitless pleasure and depth. How to describe it? It's like a children's book for adults. There's this magical other-world, other-time feel that's complex and meaningful and gorgeous. Think about a fairy tale with its shiny storyline, ex facie, that's also serving up something edifying and subtextual. Invisible Cities is the grown-up version. And the descriptions are often just curious and strange enough that you can come away with multiple meanings, in part determined by your current mental/emotional state. Sometimes I was too puzzled or infatuated with the physical description to divine much of anything coherent, but this serves to make the inevitable reread that much more appealing. As Calvino via Polo tells us, it is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear. Amen.",2009-07-27 04:58:29,5,en,2009-07-27 04:58:29,7,2009,0.00248,0.0001,0.00026,0.00012,0.00028,0.00017,307
Ivana Books Are Magic,"I listened to an audio version of this book twice (which technically puts it into a 'reread' category), for two days in a row, while I was working on a new painting. The painting turned out pretty much perfect, should I thank Calvino for that? I'm not kidding, perhaps the beauty of his prose really helped (or somehow improved) my painting process. It is not such a far fetched idea as it might seem at first. The first time I listened to this book, I was mostly focused on the form that is to say, on the language and the writing style. The second time I listened to it, I was more focused on the content, that is, the meaning behind the words. I listened to it in original (that would be Italian), but I can't remember the name of the narrator. At times, the form and the content have a way of merging together that can be challenging to describe. This is perhaps especially the case with literature (for obvious reasons). Likewise, this book is hard to classify. Is it a philosophical book? Is it a short novel? Can it truly be considered a novel? Is it a series of short stories or perhaps even better to say a series of prose poems? I'm tempted to use the word magic when trying to describe Invisible Cities, but we all already know that books are magic, don't we? At least, all the good ones are. How else can you explain that feeling of witnessing someone's soul so clearly? How else can you explain feeling your heart and mind opening up and seeing your life prostrated before you? How else can you explain all those life-changing moments than happened during reading?What is reading really? Perhaps it is something as essentially human as: Hearing a story. What is writing really? Perhaps it is something as essentially human as: Story-telling. In Invisible cities, we have Kublai Khan listening to Marco Polo as he narrates a series of stories about different cities. There is something mathematical (and probably also symbolic) about the number and the organization of these stories, but what struck me the most is (besides the already mentioned beauty of the lyrical narrative) is the philosophical aspect of these stories. Invisible stories is certainly a book that is open to interpretations. Marco Polo might be making everything up. Kublai has no ways of knowing, does he? Kublai Khan might not believe him at all. On the other hand, perhaps Khan wants to believe him (or maybe it doesn't really matter to him either way). The conversations between Polo and Khan were perhaps the most interesting part of the book. The relationship between the two set aside, this book discusses a great deal more. Why do we travel? How do we travel? Isn't travelling in time, a form of travelling as well? What kind of city do we live in? Can we live in different cities within the same city? In reference to this book, one play immediately comes to my mind and that is Orpheus Descending by Tennessee Williams. If you read that one, you might remember that famous saying that night and day people live in different cities and may never see or meet each other, meaning that people who have very different lifestyles may live in (experience) very different (versions of their) cities, even if technically speaking, they happen to live in the same city. It is fascinating to me how at ease I felt while listening to Invisible Cities. There was almost a deja vu sensation to it (and not because I have listened to the same book twice, the feeling was from the start, it only intensified with the second reading). I could imagine the 'cities' Calvino (or Marco Polo if you will) was describing, if not with an absolute precision then with a feeling very akin to intimacy. You know when you know someone so well that it is hard to know where one starts and the other ends, when their feelings become your feelings. That kind of feeling. I actually read quite a few works by Calvino, I just haven't gotten to reviewing them here on goodreads. He is certainly among my favourite modern Italian writers. This year I'll be focusing more on classics (and non-fiction), so I'm looking forward to reading more of his works. I might even return to this one (for the third time!), because this is one beautifully written book.",2018-01-11 01:11:55,5,en,2018-01-11 01:11:55,1,2018,0.0007,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,748
Sentimental Surrealist,"In a way, this book is almost too good. I'm amazed that Calvino pulled off a work that so successfully blurs the lines between poetry, short fiction and novel, one that asks us as readers to expand our perception of what fiction is, and one that drums up such a sense of sweep and wonder while at the same time giving the puzzle-lover in me all sorts of room to play; it's a step above even masterpieces of gamesmanship like Pale Fire because Calvino hits so many of my intellectual and emotional buttons. At the same time, I don't think it's gotten credit for how radical of a break from tradition it is. Only a handful of works do that in the same way for me, and some of them have more canonical visibility than others - everyone reads Borges, Maggie Nelson and Amelia Gray these days, but someone has to plug Linh Dinh, Renee Gladman and Pamela Lu here, so it might as well be me. Most works don't even try for this level of virtuosity, let alone succeed; even the fat postmodern tomes I've sworn so much allegiance to, books that the press kits swear up and down rewrote the rules of the novel, still feel on a basic level like [i]novels[/i] to me, where this is a work of its own class. So that not only makes it the finest work under the postmodern umbrella and a strong candidate for the novel that'll inevitably usurp Infinite Jest as my favorite, but pretty much the best work of playful fabulism I've read, in that it's at once the most playful and one that instills the most wonder in me. But you only get to pull that off once, and most people don't pull that off at all. Since all Calvino I've read prioritizes instilling of wonder, the book that instills the most wonder will inevitably rule roost, and in that respect even Cosmicomics is a distant second. Since this strikes me as by far the peak of Calvino's lifelong project, a book that hits notes the more-famous If on a Winter's Night a Traveler merely strains for, the rest of Calvino's work has been ruined for me, because I keep expecting him to take me where this book took me and keep finding myself not... there, you know? I wish I'd read a little more Calvino before I got here, because the rest of his work has, in a certain respect, been ruined for me by this one. It's still charming and funny and striking in its originality and intelligence, but it doesn't have the bottled-lightning effect that this book does.Well, I guess that's what happens when you blow away your competition.

Emily May,"“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”
This is a collection of short stories about the cities which the narrator - Marco Polo - has visited. He tells them to Kublai Khan, who begins to question his own empire after hearing Marco's tales. I once saw Invisible Cities called ""prose poetry"" and that seems like a fairly accurate description. It's a book made up of fragments - usually one or two pages at a time - each beautifully describing a different city. Lots of metaphors and gorgeous imagery that will take your breath away.Unfortunately, though, beyond the writing I felt a little underwhelmed. Nothing actually happens and the short snippets, while beautiful, lead nowhere and seem a touch... pointless. It's definitely a book for those who read for the words themselves, not the story.",2012-08-20 04:17:48,3,en,2012-08-20 04:17:48,8,2012,0.0014,0.0001,0.0002,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,156
Bernardo,"“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” When I first found this book at the store I thought “Now, why in the world would I want to read a book describing nonexistent cities?”. Still, I bought the book (mainly due to the positive reviews I found here), having decided to read it. I followed other readers advices and tried to restrict myself to a chapter a day. It’s not a long book, maybe even a short one at that, and you can read it in quick fashion. But I must say, how right those others readers were.At the beginning of the book I didn’t feel engaged, but as I kept on reading something changed and I became as intrigued by Marco Polo’s descriptions as the Mongol Emperor, Kublai Khan. I can’t exactly explain why. The descriptions just felt vivid and at times I felt that I was reading them just for what they were, while at other times I could see various meanings when different cities were being described. Some meanings of which could be even be applied to real life. Reading this book often felt like having a dream while being awaken. In that sense, Calvino might have mirrored the readers in his characters, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. I still can’t explain what it is about Calvino’s writing that I particularly enjoyed, but I’m willing to read more.",2021-09-02 02:32:28,4,en,2021-09-02 02:32:28,9,2021,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,253
Stuart,"Invisible Cities: Philosophical sketches of imaginary citiesOriginally posted at Fantasy LiteratureItalo Calvino has long been on my list of foreign writers of the fantastic who have been deeply influential to SFF writers while remaining only tangential to the genre. This would include the great Jorge Luis Borges, as well as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. All these writers revel in philosophical musings, magic realism, and intellectual play. They belong to the deeper end of the fantastic literature swimming pool, but adventurous readers and authors have often plunged into those depths to one degree or another.Invisible Cities was first published in Italian in 1972 but appeared in English in 1974 and was a surprise nominee for the Nebula Award in 1976. It is a unique and almost unclassifiable work, a 165-page collection of brief 1-2 page vignettes much like prose poems, describing 55 cities all with women’s names. The book’s structure is very formalized, being further broken down into 11 themes: Cities &amp; Memory, Cities &amp; Desire, Cities &amp; Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities &amp; Eyes, Cities &amp; Names, Cities &amp; the Dead, Cities &amp; the Sky, Continuous Cities, and Hidden Cities. Given the number of hidden cities embedded in the stories, the real total is much higher.Each vignette is brief and without characters — it simply described each city in poetic imagery. It is difficult to do justice to the incredible variety of cities that Calvino conjures from his imagination, so I will choose a single sample at random. Essentially any passage in the book is quotable, but conversely no single passage can encompass the myriad ideas and emotions that the book explores and conjures up. Here is an early passage from Cities &amp; Desire:But with all this, I would not be telling you the city’s true essence; for while the description of Anastasia awakens desires one at a time only to force you to stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia one morning your desires waken all at once and surround you. The city appears to you as a whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit this desire and be content. Such is the power, sometimes called malignant, sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous city, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave. These stories are then framed by a recurring dialogue between an aged Kublai Khan and young adventurer Marco Polo. Polo is asked by the Khan to regale him with exotic tales of his travels to the far parts of the Khan’s vast empire, but as Invisible Cities progresses, Khan begins to question the reality of many of Polo’s more fantastic tales, and also turns the tables and offers his own ideas of imaginary cities. Their discussion becomes increasingly metaphysical, as the veracity of these cities is questioned, along with the capacity for language to capture the essence of these fabulous places. There is much debate over the nature of storytelling, imagination, and metaphysics. Again, a brief sample:Marco Polo — It has neither name nor place. I shall repeat the reason why I was describing it to you: from the number of imaginable cities we must exclude those whose elements are assembled without a connecting thread, an inner rule, a perspective, a discourse. With cities, it is as with dreams; everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like daydreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else. The cities that Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan are exactly that — dreams of the imagination, depictions of ideas, emotions, philosophies, semiotics, and explorations of language and poetry. So the book itself can be entered at any point, and any single conclusion may point to one aspect of the overall meaning of the book but will never encompass it completely. In more direct terms, the significance of this book cannot be narrowed to a single idea or phrase, but it touches on all these things, a literary experiment by a very daring intellect, and each reader will have varying emotional reactions to Invisible Cities. If that sounds like something you would like to try it should be a very rewarding experience (5 stars in that case). If you prefer more traditional characters and plot-based storytelling, you will be probably be disappointed (3 stars in that case). Overall, I will assign it 4 stars.",2017-01-07 07:01:48,4,en,2017-01-07 07:01:48,1,2017,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,807
MJ Nicholls,"I read the edition translated into Scots by Wullie Weaver. Here are a few excerpts:Repulsive Cities ∙ 2The red brick edifices tower over the populace, signifers of a forgotten dream, of a thought abandoned in the ailing conscious of intrepid colonial adventurers. A range of hominids patrol the looming DSS office walls, dishing out abuse to obese mothers and wageless wanderers. This is a city of broken faeces, a city of cross-eyed big brothers, watching from the skies for a sign of salvation, something to lift this horrible land to a brighter plateau. In every repulsive city there is a gem, a signal: the kindly arms of naïve temptresses.Backward Cities ∙ 5In a field of obtuse posies I come across a farmer, tilling the field with his bent hoe, straining crops into order. “Quaint vassal, wherefore the heart of this green desert?” I ask. “In the shiny breasts of my daughter, that’s where, oh-lordy-aye,” he says. Across the road I spy a girl with the face of this man, his features as though transcribed on her red-rosied skin. All around me, a tissue of incestuous progenies, mixing their colours, discussing the fastest route into hell, where redemption no longer achieves the mythos of a dream.Pretentious Cities ∙ 1Among the golden buttresses sits a Lord, his luxurious grey beard brushing the bespectacled inhabitants, reading from the Great Works. Etched in history, the builders and planners, their names spelt in flashing neon clouds, passing through the streets, filling the people with words and ideas. Down the street a gemstone, doused in the milks of the Great Poets, where scholars feed from, where the fools are sacrificed at the altar of knowledge.",2011-04-15 06:06:34,4,en,2011-04-15 06:06:34,4,2011,0.00532,0.00011,0.00034,0.00012,0.00044,0.0003,279
Fede,"The soul of Architecture; the architecture of the Soul. Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" is a magnificent, melancholic allegory: the architecture of civilisation. Architecture is certainly not the urban landscape in which fancy designers and capitalist sharks shake hands in order to confine us into a waste land of shabby outskirts and futuristic ziggurats of glass and steel; neither it is the post-atomic desert of most dystopian literature; not even the frantic alienation of some nightmarish Metropolis. These are mere 'topoi', sadly turned into clichés by literature and film industry. Architecture is neither the deafening bulldozers and cranes scattered in our cities nor the silent dust whirling over Hiroshima. That's only the surface. Architecture is the naive enthusiasm of the Futurists; it's Albert Speer's demented grandeur; it's the astrological obsessions of the Egyptian engineers; it's the Aztec nightmarish temples for antropophagic deities; it's the aesthetic genius of a thousand peasants dreaming in front of a thousand gorgeous Alhambras and multicolored Russian domes. It's the shape our civilisation gives itself. Civilisation is not a product of our hands, it's a product of our collective mind. Sometimes that collective mind works and we build the Taj Mahal, sometimes it goes astray and we build Treblinka.Architecture is the attempt to give mankind's sensitivity a tangible, visible shape; a shape that can only be metaphysical in its inner nature.In fact what Calvino does in this amazing book has more to do with visual art than literature, as though his beautiful prose were a means to convey an exquisitely sensuous and intimate feeling of introspection, silent contemplation... and disquiet. This book is a collection of prose-poems talking about cities as archetypes. Structured as part of an imaginary dialogue between Marco Polo (a 13th century Venetian emissary who travelled to the Far East) and Kubla Khan (see Coleridge...), its short chapters are poetic, delicate descriptions of cities beyond time and space. All of them have unusual female names, mostly borrowed from Greek amd Latin myths and literature. These dreamscapes are classified in eleven threads, although the author doesn't follow any regular sequence other than the one suggested by random inspiration. 1) Cities and Memory:Cities in which the present wanes, stuck as it is between a forgotten past and a still unknown future; Dorotea for instance, ""where desires have already turned into memories"". 2) Cities and Desire:Cities living out of men's expectations and hopes; Anastasia, the City of Sin, where pleasure is delusional and the inhabitants are unconsciously enslaved by their own desires. 3) Cities and Signs:Where reality is pure epistemology; in Tamara, the city of ubiquitous advertisement and representation, ""the eye doesn't see things but the image of things meaning something else."" In Ipazia, the meaning of things is to be found in their opposites.4) Thin Cities:Their surreal texture eludes any reference to reality. 'Thin' as 'spiritual', airy places such as Octavia, the Cobweb City hanging above the abyss. 5) Trading Cities:Where life means restless exchange: of stories, feelings, money, experiences, failures. It's the most social dimension of civilisation. 6) Cities and Eyes:They're reflections of the inner life of their population; Valdrada, the city living in symbiosis with its reflection mirrored by the lake; or Zemrude, taking the shape of its inhabitants' moods. 7) Cities and Names: Conceptual cities in which reality is determined by language and conventional memories, such as Irene, talked about all the time but only seen from a distance. 8) Cities of the Dead:Reminding of A. Böcklin's imagery. One of these cities is Eusapia, modelled on its underground 'double' in which the dead are supposed to dwell, sort of a grotesque, tragi-comic necropolis.9) Cities and the Sky:Earthly projections of the universe, built to fit constellations and planets (seen as the symbol of order and perfection). In Perintia something went wrong, though: its popolation is monstrously misshapen and chronically ill. Did they botch their calculations? Or maybe that's the true order of the universe? 10) Continuous Cities:They keep growing uncontrollably to the point of destroying themselves, like tumors; as in the case of Leonia, surrounded by huge junkyards threatening to bury the whole city in its own decay. 11) Hidden Cities:Parallel universes flourishing beneath the surface of cities like Theodora, forever struggling against rats, vermin, vultures and any sort of parasites living their own 'urban' life in the grooves of our existence. These are Calvino's Cities.Invisible Cities indeed... why do they look so familiar then? There's neither a Marco Polo nor a Kubla Khan really; this is not a dialogue, it's a vision, a dream, a shadow - or rather a twilight, an emperor's last glance on his dominion falling to pieces. Any attempt to ignore the metaphorical meaning of these characters would be pointless and misleading. The author himself unveils the truth in chapter 7, when the protagonists ask each other whether they really exist or not. After all, Calvino's Marco Polo talks about trains, ferries, airports... who could ever be so blind not to figure it out from the very beginning? It's less a dialogue than a monologue on the City as the only dimension in which mankind can live as such: in a nutshell, civilisation. Hallucinated, dreamy, pragmatic, delusional, liberating... human. Whether it is Heaven or Hell we're headed to, it's up to the reader to decide, given that: "" The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space. "" Although Calvino is far from being among my favourite authors, I adored this book. There's a strange magic in any single page, paragraph, sentence, word. Any short chapter is a stand-alone piece of poetic prose, an enchanting picture painted with the most delicate touch. I shouldn't be talking about prose actually; I compare prose to artistic photography, whereas this is a hologram, a Fata Morgana, a lantern show... A multifaceted reading experience. To be tasted at sunset, peacefully, slowly, like the most exotic fruit of Calvino's orchard.",2018-06-28 22:06:05,5,en,2018-06-28 22:06:05,6,2018,0.00154,0.00011,0.00022,0.00012,0.0002,0.00018,1064

Lit Bug,"I should probably admit that Calvino is a gifted writer – he writes so exquisitely, it is difficult to put down a book by him even if it doesn’t make sense to me. My second Calvino, and my response to it is the same I had when I read his first some years ago (If on a winter’s night a traveler) – I didn’t understand a damn thing, and couldn’t put it down either. Worse, I couldn’t rate it at all. I didn’t even know what I thought of it. Fortunately, I re-read ‘If on a…’ some time back, and to my utter surprise, not only understood it, but loved it as well. Again, I read this one for the first time, and have absolutely no idea what on earth I’ve just finished.I gathered it is about Venice, but cannot make out what it means at all. I went through Wiki page, GR reviews, blog reviews – they all made sense, and yet I couldn’t connect the dots of this book. I guess I’m not ready for this book yet. But I’ll read it again, because, funnily, weirdly enough, I liked it.So while I cannot talk about the finer aspects of the book, I will only mention some quotes that caught my attention.
  “The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”

  ”Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”

  ”You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.”…… “Or the questions it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.”

  ”It is not the voice that commands the story; it is the ear.”
I quite enjoyed the account of the twin cities of Eusapia, the living city on the ground, and the dead one beneath it, and the mystery of which city built the other.Also interesting was the allusion to chess, through which Kublai Khan attempted to understand and master moves of conquest – after all, chess is a territorial game with kings and their armies vying for conquest.The mention of dystopian, nightmarish literary cities – Oceania, Brave New World, Enoch, Yahooland, Babylon, Butua was a surprise element and what Marco Polo says about them, ending the book, was such a beautiful observation:
  “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live everyday, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”
Calvino is a master weaver with a knack for phrasing – he takes well-chewn ideas and molds them in a pleasant, novel way. I find him very similar to Rushdie in his skill for reinventing phrases – the only difference is that while Rushdie is incisive, in-your-face, Calvino is sophisticated, urbane. Unlike Rushdie, Calvino does not make us wince. Calvino’s edges are smooth, polished, whereas Rushdie’s are lacerating.On a parting note, I plan to read this again later, and hopefully, I’ll discover some pleasures I am not perceptive enough to enjoy now. Till then, no rating either.",2013-09-20 13:29:18,0,en,2013-09-20 13:29:18,9,2013,0.00311,0.00011,0.00038,0.00012,0.00027,0.00017,612
David,"Calvino's Invisible Cities is more a chronicle of linked prose poetry than it is a novel. Marco Polo, the Scheherazadean narrator, tells Kublai Khan about the fifty-five (is it really only that many?) of impossibly imaginative cities which he has encountered along his travels. Whether cities of the dead, or continuous cities, or what-have-you, every city has some element of the paradoxical, or the impossible and irrational. This Borgesian labyrinth of falsity mixed with truth is gripping. And though each city is a lie, each city, too, holds a kernel of some deeper truth about life - and isn't that what literature is all about? Truth through falsity?And our lives are expanded through falsities and half-truths and unknowables. Every person we meet, every thing we see, everything we hear, expands our consciousness and adds value to our lives. It's how we compile these sensory experiences that defines our lives, that makes a ""heaven out of hell, or a hell out of heaven,"" so to speak. Perspective is the flavor of life and no two people have the same tastes. But can we have more tastes than one? I suspect a good novelist can taste life through a number of different perspectives than their own, which makes fiction so appealing to us, every book a new flavor, a new perspective: getting closer to that singular truth.For Marco Polo, the singular truth at the heart of Invisible Cities is the one city which he really knows, which he really loves, which to him is everything: Venice. At one and the same time, he seems to know everything about Venice, yet seems also to be doggedly search for the heart of it; has it firmly in his grasp, yet is ceaselessly losing it:
  “Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,"" Polo said. ""Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it, or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.”
Perhaps he is losing it piece by piece because city by imaginary city he is uncovering it. The mystery which remained for him in Venice, which he hoped to preserve, he loses little by little in getting at the truth of the illusory metropolises of his mind. When you escape into a good book, the world falls away from you, you are transported, but when you return the world is not quite the way it was before: there is a different color to the sunlight, a different touch to your bedsheets, a different feel of the wind at your back on a hot summer day. Something is added to your appreciation of the world you live in: but maybe not - maybe it is that something is taken away, some barrier torn down, some dust wiped away, which makes your vision clearer.",2012-10-16 10:40:32,4,en,2012-10-16 10:40:32,10,2012,0.00298,0.0001,0.00027,0.00013,0.00027,0.0002,473
Jonathan,"One of my favourite books, read and re-read many times. ****Joseph Mcelroy's review from the New York Times, 1974 (transcription errors obviously mine - tried to do what I could): ""Invisible Cities"" is a new book by Italy's most original storyteller, Italo Calvino. But this time not a book of stories. Something more.In ""Cosmicomics"" Calvino found a way to make fables out of evolution. The fables emerged like elemental anecdotes from opening hypotheses, and the biology, the physics, the astronomy, were much more knowledgeable than Calvino the entertainer let them seem. But in ""t zero"" (which in my opinion was one of the most important works of fiction published during the sixties), Calvino accepted his scientific subject matter less whimsically. He deepened and complicated his visionand voices. He moved into mathematics. He imagined what it might feel like when a one-celled self divides.In his earlier historical romances that theme of growth had been seen through a kind of uncertain satirical fancy. A young baron takes to the trees in protest against society, and stays there to become an arboreal amphibian, a rebel mutant. A young viscount goes away to war only to be blown apart; his nasty half returns home like some subversion of himself but at long last is rejoined to his long lost good half.Recently, in ""Smog"" and in two of the ""t zero"" stories, Calvino has turned the precise play of his mind upon separations and isolations in urban life. And now, in ""Invisible Cities,"" he has transmuted his themes into something new. The wonderful phenomena of ""Invisible Cities"" are seen as through some unfolding nuclear kaleidoscope. Past and future possibility grow out of the prison of an ""unlivable present, where all forms of human society have reached an extreme of their cycle and there is no imagining what newforms they may assume.""These words-in William Weaver's beautifully seductive translation-are spoken by an imaginary Kublai Khan, old and pessimistic, for one of the book's two interleaved narratives is his curious, elegiac conversation with his employee, the Venetian traveller Marco Polo. The second narrative-which fills the book's main spaces and makes it not so much a parody of the 13th-century ""Travels"" as an alternative meditation-is what Marco brings the Khan: an account of fifty-odd cities Marco has visited. Thin cities, double cities, cities suspended-cities, despite Calvino's title, exactly and fascinatingly visible-cities such as Hypatia, in whose lagoons crabs bite the eyes of suicides; or Thekla, where new building never stops lest destruction begin: or three-fold Beersheba projecting celestial jewel-like self above, and base city of cheese rinds and fish scales below, but officially ignoring its ""only free and happy action,"" defecating.Why does the emperor ask the traveler to tell him what is in his empire? Partly because the emperor cannot know what is in it. Perhaps because he may wish not to know, but also because he must wish to feel in its deterioration some chance of growth.Calvino's twin narratives lean toward and away from each other. The cities, for all their distilled form, represent Mass. The intermittent conversation between the Khan and Marco Polo is Form; it is the will to simplify; it is also a dialogue between the imperial will to impose and possess and the power to rest in the contemplation of multiplicity. At first, the Khan finds in Marco's accounts ""a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites' gnawing."" Then, as the two men talk, cities come to seem ""consolatory fables,"" states of mind, phantasms.Yet in the main narrative these cities have the glint of substance; they are alluring, disturbing and distinct as if possessed of the significance of a Kafka parable. On the other hand, though each city has its special quality, Calvino's gazetteer is elusive, for it embraces perverse paradoxes and sequences within sequences. We are warned not to confuse cities with the words used to describe them; yet we are told that falsehood is not in words but in things. Cities of Signs touch Cities of Memory.The voluptuous Trading City Chloe, where strangers (like figures out of RobbeGrillet's ""La Maison des Rendezvous"") consummate strange intimacies in silence, may remind us of that Hid en City of sadness, Raissa, ""where runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another ... unravels ... draws new patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.""Calvino's elusiveness comes also from the honesty with which he develops his series. ""Invisible Cities"" is an elegy, autumnal and melancholy. Cities do move more and more toward failure, and toward the end of the book Procopia, the last of the ""Continuous Cities,"" is so crowded that the people hide the place and even the sky.And there is Penthesilea, less an ""aggregation of opaque polyhedrons on the horizon"" than a limbo of endless outskirts. But the reader finds something more interesting here than decline and fall. Even the cities that exhibit delusion and degeneration remain the possibilities from which, as Marco tells the Khan, any crystal-perfect community whose molecular form the Khan dreams of must in part be calculated.In Laudamia death seems a function of ignorance, yet they are subtly balanced by the strict and close attention Calvino's lens draws from us. If Perinthia, like some old rational Utopia designed to reflect the pattern of the heavens, is, doomed, Calvino has yet more complex appreciations of order to offer us. In Andria, whose layout and calendar reflect the firmament, alterations nonetheless occur all the time and ""any, change in Andria involves some novelty in the stars."" And since ""every innovation in the city influences the sky's pattern,"" the Andrians must think of the consequences ""for all worlds."" And then at last we reach what seems almost to be the secret center of Calvino's vision: Berenice, where the just city grows within the unjust city but will itself become unjust in its time as surely as it its [illegible]Still, Babylon and Yahooland will not go away. And the Khan's great atlas unveils shapeless networks of the future-Los Angeles, Kyoto-Osaka. Yet then I remember those closing stories of ""t zero"" in which the mind makes new space within patterns of imprisonment, and does so in speculations that accept analysis and technology not simply as the enemy but as models and targets of intense and vital attention. For I believe it is some such space that Calvino has created for his archetypal communities.If they are forms, they are also like signals condensing in themselves power that awaits its translation into form. And Calvino's book is like no other I know.",2012-10-12 23:18:30,5,en,2012-10-12 23:18:30,10,2012,0.00084,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,1098
Joy D,"Poetically written novella featuring an imagined conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. It is atmospheric. Some “cities” are places that sound wonderful – a place to go visit, while others are dilapidated and unpleasant. The cities described by Marco Polo turn out to be specific aspects of a singular city. I treated it as a meditation, reading it in small bits and pieces, and re-reading segments. This is my preferred type of experimental fiction. The language flows beautifully. It is not anything like a traditional story, but I enjoyed it.",2022-08-03 00:05:27,4,en,2022-08-03 00:05:27,8,2022,0.00056,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,91
Kirstine,"“<em>Cities like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.</em>”Exquisite read about the way we experience the world around us, what we take with us when we travel, what we bring back and the possibilities of imagination. It’s about specific cities, all cities and one city. It’s about the real ones, the past and the now and the imagined ones, the past and the future – and also the now. Every city you’ve ever been in will fit every description in this book, if you look at it right; through memory, desire, death, language, eyes, trade. It’s both a somewhat whimsical and deeply serious book. It mixes history with modern day with magic and make belief. Sometimes I felt his modern references took away from the otherwise very fluid and dream-like experience, because it forced you back into reality. You were no longer imagining cities in all their splendor and decay, in all their improbable and romantic glory, you were no longer using imagination, you accidentally switched to memories, which bothered me a bit. If he insists on referencing airports and train stations, I wish he’d been more vague about it. It’s infused with a sense of dreaming, of lines between reality and fiction being blurred and everything being possible. It’s at times breathtaking and at times rotten, covering the great expanse between what we see and experience and what is really there, all written in small chapters, each on a different city, from a particular perspective (11 themes, 5 cities for each, a total of 55 cities are described). I’d love to own this as a paperback and bring it with me whenever I go somewhere. I’d sit somewhere and read and try to find Isidora, Euphemia, Valdrada, Olivia, Baucis, Pyrrha, Moriana, Irene, Raissa or Penthesilea in whatever place I’m in. To look at the world through memory or signs. To imagine what they might be or have been. To find the city hidden within the city. To be this book’s Marco Polo and travel the world in my mind and outside of it. It might be a foolish desire, but what an exquisite experience it would be.",2014-03-20 21:16:23,5,en,2014-03-20 21:16:23,3,2014,0.00215,0.0001,0.00022,0.00012,0.00023,0.00018,379
Vladys Kovsky,"Timing is everything. Had I read this book at the time of my obsession with postmodernism, I would have been enthralled. I would have spent hours and days identifying painstakingly all the connections between various cities, their meanings and symbols. Calvino would have become one of my favorite authors, I would have sought out everything he had written.As it was, another -ism that captivated me for a while eventually lost its allure. When the book finally reached me - the sparkling imagination, the fabulous execution, the magical packaging left me cold. And while some cities, some reflections on human behavior were amusing they did not really touch me until I noticed the ever intensifying change of the tone from light and playful, to absurd, and then to predominantly dark. It is in this gloom where the author of Invisible Cities takes you before delivering his most quoted phrase, a nugget of gold you can't miss as it is no longer invisible:“The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”",2021-02-26 23:54:39,3,en,2021-02-26 23:54:39,2,2021,0.00583,0.00013,0.00063,0.00016,0.00045,0.00024,258
Mon,"Invisible Cities: A ParodyNow i shall tell of the city of Yendys, which is wonderful in this fashion: though set on an even coastal plane with mediocre breeze and timid weather, the houses and decorated sheds are of bricks and corrugated iron, connected to each other with quiet courtyards split by pairs, surrounded with exotic, tidy bush of ginormous flowers, man-sized tin water tanks, weather vanes and shinny Japanese vehicles parked on dark grey gravel street that glistens under the sun. No one knows why the houses resemble European Tudor or Georgian styles so much, so there is no telling whether the city was satisfied by the suburban gesture. In some inner city zones, perhaps through liberal reform and bloody council battles, a foreign, hipster array of successive coloured oddities stand at crooked angles among rusted steel frame warehouses, now converted to underground DJ joints for the city's inhabitants. This said, it is pointless to decide whether Yendys is to be classified among the winning cities or among loser cities. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to zombie pollution, and those in which such poison either erase the city or are erased by it.",2011-03-31 05:54:57,4,en,2011-03-31 05:54:57,3,2011,0.00081,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,217

Ray,"In invisible cities Calvino conjures a vision of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in discussion about the myriad cities that Polo has visited. However with Calvino it is not as simple as that. The cities and their inhabitants are fantastical. The language is as rich and playful as ever.I am always impressed by the sheer inventiveness of the author. We have cities filled to the brim with teeming masses, cities built on spiders webs of cables, cities where the realm of the dead and yet to be born co-exist with the living , and many many more.To me this book was also about the vaguries and selectiveness of memory, the impossibility of capturing everything with language and the ability to miscommunicate - or at least communicate imprecisely - with another person.Worth a read",2015-09-11 17:07:03,4,en,2015-09-11 17:07:03,9,2015,0.00081,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,133
Chris_P,"Readers can be divided into two separate categories. Those who need clear plots and are OK with metaphors and abstract devices as long as they are part of a storyline, and those who are perfectly fine with pure fantasy and plotless descriptions of extraordinary places, characters etc. For better or for worse, I belong to the first category. Therefore, for me Invisible Cities was a joyful ride but I failed to fully connect with it. That said, Calvino's prose can carry away even the most unsatisfied reader and there are parts that beg to be revisited again and again and which I'd rate with five stars if I could.",2017-11-20 01:38:19,3,en,2017-11-20 01:38:19,11,2017,0.00071,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,109
Jason,"Marco tells Kublai of a city far away, one that was originally reached by a river, then built up further along railways, and is now encircled and vivisected by black roads in constant disrepair and yet always being newly paved. Marco describes a city that is one of industry, one of learning, and one of historical importance in so far as the new world's history goes. He tells Kublai of the city that has it's leader's pristine white residence built on a hill of green and then immediately surrounded by structures of steel and glass. He describes the people that live in this city, the people that populate massive homes both gated and immaculately manicured, as well as those that live only blocks away on the streets and in the parks, and he also tells of the migratory youth population that racks up debt from the cities institutions of learning while frequenting the lower establishments of drink, dancing, and general debauchery. It is a crumbling city and a growing city, a city of conservative establishments and budding liberal upstarts, a city of street culture and high culture - the city Marco details goes by the name of Richmond (Virginia, USA) and is a middling city both strangely idyllic and strikingly unremarkable.A beautifully written and brilliant exploration into cities - what they are, how they are perceived, and what any of it really means. An excellent thought exercise that will open your eyes to your own surroundings. You will see them from new points of view, an infinite number of them. It will also make one itch to travel to new places and explore, finding unique places to your own experience, for a city is different to each set of eyes that are laid upon it.",2014-07-13 02:50:29,4,en,2014-07-13 02:50:29,7,2014,0.00188,0.00012,0.00027,0.00013,0.00024,0.0002,295
Matt,"Perhaps my previous experiences with Calvino's writings led me to expect something different out of this book. Each short chapter certainly had plenty to make me think about, but after finishing the book as a whole I am having a hard time putting all of those thoughts together in a coherent way. I liked it. I really did. But I'm left more with a feeling of not having understood something very important from the whole 'story'...something Calvino wanted me to understand. Is it really just the fragments of beautiful imagery and poignant observations that the reader is to walk away with after reading this? If so, then I need to re-read it with that in mind - maybe just pick it up from time to time and read a random chapter to get the mental wheels spinning. If not, then I need to re-read it with a keener mindset, and I need to talk with 'someone' about what I've missed.Either way, looks like this one should never be far from my reach.",2007-07-21 21:57:59,2,en,2007-07-21 21:57:59,7,2007,0.00057,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,172

Stephanie Sun,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.Imagine holding in a fart for eleven years and finally being able to let it out.That's what reading, and finally finishing (eleven years after receiving it as a college graduation gift), Invisible Cities was like for me in October 2013.In a journey as recursive, prototypical, and double-blind as anything Italo himself could have hoped for, for eleven years this book has followed me to the humid climes of Malaya, various burros of New Yuck, and finally to the city that Calvino as the slightly more eccentric of his two alter-egos described as ""span[ning] the Golden Gate and the bay with long, light bridges... open trains climbing its steep streets, and which might blossom as capital of the Pacific a millennium hence, after the long siege of three hundred years that would lead the races of the yellow and the black and the red to fuse with the surviving descendants of the whites in an empire more vast than the Great Khan's.""*That's eleven years of guilt and inadequacy, eleven years of I tried that and I do not like it, eleven years of bitter resentment at the fawning of easily impressed literary types over post-modernist drivel...Eleven years of being completely and totally wrong. This is brilliant. It is about cities and stories, about the way both cities and stories endure and yet are in constant motion, about the aggregations of death and life they contain. I read this, of course, as a former New Yorker. Just as Marco Polo saw Venice everywhere, so did so many of the Venetian's descriptions of fantastical cities (that are all really Venice) evoke for me the way New York could change (to paraphrase Joss Whedon about one of his actors) ""from Jack Benny to Dracula in a heartbeat."" Calvino gets how the beauty, Gothic horrorshow, stress, and fun of city life are all mixed up together in one big pot of crazy, how in fact your Gothic horrorshow may be someone else's fun, and so on and so forth. I guess all writers who write about city life, or post-war America, or their cats, okay, basically all writers, try to get at this point, but in doing so directly, with realistic characters and dialogue, they don't capture the absurdity in all its stripes the way Calvino does here.That brings me to the voice... If you are anything like twenty-three- to thirty-two-year-old me you will hate the voice of this book. It is as affected and twee as the giggle of a Japanese teenager. And that's where it all comes back to timing. It wasn't just that I had never lived in a city for longer than two months when I first picked up this book and couldn't connect with the subject matter the way that I can today. It's also that my life entered a moment of peak absurdity around the time I picked up this book a second time, and so I took to its absurd voice and general absurdly absurd absurdness like Calvino to a striking series of unrelated objects.In 165 pages, Calvino will show you both the pitchest blacks and silliest joys of the universe and leave you sighing with recognition and relief.* Whoa.

Ethan,"""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents.""The most fun I've had reading a book in a long time came when I was a fly on the wall during the fascinating conversations between Marco Polo and the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan in Invisible Cities, because make no mistake, I was there. Or, at least, it feels like I was. Calvino has a magic gift for storytelling that pulls you into the narrative unlike any author I've read in recent memory. You spend time in each of the fascinating cities Polo describes. You feel their atmosphere, see their every eccentric feature come alive before your eyes.People compare Calvino to Borges. Calvino is better. Borges focused on creating a cerebral thought experiment, with deep reflections and wordy obfuscation first and the enjoyment of the reader second. Calvino has these priorities backwards, making him far more enjoyable.The powerful, thought-provoking insights into the nature of travel and cities and even reality and civilization themselves, interwoven in beautifully-written, poetic tales, makes for an absolute masterpiece. This is one of the top ten books I have ever read, and I don't see it slipping from that list anytime soon.

HBalikov,A subtle book of small pleasures. Marco Polo spins (like Sheherazade to her ruler) tales of fantastic cities to Kublai Khan. Each is a small jewel.

Girish,"Towards the end of this marvellous book Marco Polo says ""I speak and I speak, but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear"". Nothing could be more true especially in the context of the book.Invisible cities is a book that speaks to the soul and stirs thoughts and memories and paints Freudian/Jungian images. To describe it would mean to distort it and to distort it, well, you wouldn't know how. The book might seem abstract at the beginning what with Marco Polo describing imaginary cities to the Chinese rule Kublai Khan from his travels. The Great Khan knows Polo is making things up, but the mesmeric nature of the narrative makes him converse. Calvino plays with the deep fact that people associate any city with it's history, memories, dreams, utility, future, customs and beliefs. During my courtship period, I used to travel to and through cities that bore no attachment to me. When my wife(then fiancée) used to ask me about the cities I have been to, I used to narrate part facts, part exaggerated memories, part descriptions inebriated in love, part images that would make her wish she was there and she took it all in. Now she likes some cities, hates some and definitely want to visit a few. To many people I have associated Shillong with the one incident of people pausing to allow a cloud to pass through the room. I am sure every person who added it to their bucket list visualises clouds standing outside the windows waiting to interrupt them in mid conversation. This is the sort of effect the book has on your soul. I re-read each chapter twice to take in the beauty and surrealism. Oh, did i mention you can read chapters of related themes skipping pages to understand that one theme better? Even the grim sounding chapters like Cities &amp; the Dead have a magical effect on you. This book is brilliance. Hats off to Calvino!",2016-01-04 10:18:48,5,en,2016-01-04 10:18:48,1,2016,0.00166,0.0001,0.0002,0.00013,0.00021,0.00017,341
John,"Membership in Goodreads has its requirements, and I'd have to turn in my badge if I didn't post something on the late-century grandmaster Calvino. INVISIBLE CITIES emerges as the one to celebrate, though he never wrote a loser, and I'd never have a library without COSMICOMICS or THE BARON IN THE TREES. Still, CITIES is the one that's laid out songlines across all the continents of reading. By some miracle of imagination, Calvino pulls off both a form no one had ever seen before and a structure that feels classic. He presents conversations at twilight, always a setting alive with suggestion, and moreso when you consider the participants, namely, the wandering Marco Polo and his stay-at-home host, the Great Khan. Yet the merchant has the advantage over the emperor; he knows the far-flung cities of the Khanate. Thus by far the majority of Calvino's story -- a story-surrogate? -- is given over to dazzling one- or two-page portraits of these cities, their names ranging from Adelma to Zoe, their idiosyncrasies unparalleled in fiction. Shadows loom of timeless human dilemmas, in particular desire and the death that comes with its quenching, and the cityscapes also make room for contemporary urban threats and hardships, from overpopulation to sprawl (troubles heightened in the fragile infrastructure of Italian cities). Yet the vitality always scoots free of the thudding bootheels of Significance, and even the scariest trip downtown offers a kind of charm, the best kind, raw and head-clearing. All in all it's an experience of spacey mathematics and freethinking rigor, and though now 35 years old, still the most winning latter-day recalibration of novel-length narrative. Its influence can be felt fiction of every language, and its transcendence can open any mind wider, at any time.",2008-09-28 02:27:58,5,en,2008-09-28 02:27:58,9,2008,0.00091,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,291

Vonia,"Reading this, I found it difficult to believe that it was not done by the same author of ""Einstein's​ Dreams"". (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). Obviously, it was not. Alan Lightman's novel was published in 1992, exactly twenty years after ""Invisible Cities"". I do not believe I am the only one to have noticed this. I really hate to say this, since I am actually quite a fan of Italo Calvino's, but I found Alan Lightman's poetic elegy to time to be, rather than a derivitive, better. Perhaps better is not the word to be used, but to say that it is a great example of an author taking inspiration from the style of another author, adding to it and improving upon it for a result that I personally had more pleasure reading. Both novels/novellas are a collection of short vignettes describing cities/worlds surrounding a theme, written in dream-like prose and interwoven with interludes. Lightman's are on relativity/time/space, interludes are Einstein's conversations with his friend Michelle Besso, as he tries to finish his patent for the theory of relativity; Calvino's is on architecture/cities, interludes are conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Of course, this is only on the surface; the portrait are in fact also about the human condition, life, philosophy, psychology. Lightman's vignettes are a few to several pages long, while Calvin's are rarely more than a couple pages, if that. Why, then, do I like Alan Lightman's work significantly more than it's predecessor? While ""Einstein's Dreams"" always had an anchor in reality; at least something tangible, ""Invisible Cities"" only left me feeling like I was lost in an Escher sketch. Things disappearing, the unreliability of the city names, the inability to really say anything is for sure, since all the vignettes are descriptions of supposedly different cities? No wait, they are probably of one city, Calvino's Venice. Both characters deliberately converse in riddles, both openly confessing to giving into fantasies, regardless of fact. ""Einstein's Dreams"" was written in elegant prose, with words that painted beautiful images and evoked a dreamlike mood, but they described facts, they described different dimensions and worlds in which space and time was manipulated in a panoply of creative ways. ""Invisible Cities"" was also written with elegant prose that evoked a dreamlike mood, but that was it. And then, the chapter/vignette would end, and ""another"" city would be introduced. And this happens 54 more times, the reader never finding the exit to the labyrinth. Maybe if I liked the confusing state this induces, best compared to hallucinogens, I would have liked this better. Maybe it is indicative that I avoid drugs precisely to avoid the acute discombobulation (or what I would refer to as torturous discombobulation). This is not too say I do not appreciate poetry and prose. It is true, though, that I prefer the ones that are more concrete. For instance, both works contain the portrait of a city that is raised into the air by its citizens by stilts. Calvino described the city with beautiful prose, but ends it In Lightman's version, he tells us that this is because time moves slower closet to the ground and society is such that privilege is now synonymous to height; we have lost track of what is truly important in our quest to move faster and not lose time. Only those considered lowly venture down to earth, seen as losing time and therefore greatness. This leaves the reader contemplating how we are also so preoccupied with rushing ahead that we forget to appreciate the small things. The book explores imagination and the imaginable through the descriptions of cities by an explorer, Marco Polo, to the Emperor of Kublai Khan, who constantly has merchants coming to describe the state of his expanding and vast empire, and Polo. These descriptions are written as brief prose poems/vignettes, for 55 fictitious cities that are narrated by Polo to prove the expanse of Khan's empire, but which are all actually descriptions of one city, Venice. Short dialogues between the two characters are interspersed every five to ten cities and are used to discuss various ideas presented by the cities on a wide range of topics including linguistics and human nature. The interludes between Khan and Polo are no less poetically constructed than the cities, and form a framing device that plays with the natural complexity of language and stories. Over the nine chapters, Marco describes a total of fifty-five cities, all women's names. The cities are divided into eleven thematic groups of five each: Cities &amp; MemoryCities &amp; DesireCities &amp; SignsThin CitiesTrading CitiesCities &amp; EyesCities &amp; NamesCities &amp; the DeadCities &amp; the SkyContinuous CitiesHidden Cities Wikipedia informed me of the wonders that clearly went over my head as far as the intricate beauty hidden behind ""Invisible Cities"":  He moves back and forth between the groups, while moving down the list, in a rigorous mathematical structure. In each of the nine chapters, there is an opening section and a closing section, narrating dialogues between the Khan and Marco. The descriptions of the cities lie between these two sections.[The original article includes a spreadsheet matrix here.] The matrix of eleven column themes and fifty-five subchapters (ten rows in chapters 1 and 9, five in all others) shows some interesting properties. Each column has five entries, rows only one, so there are fifty-five cities in all. The matrix of cities has a central element (Baucis). The pattern of cities is symmetric with respect to inversion about that center. Equivalently, it is symmetric against 180 degree rotations about Baucis. Inner chapters (2-8 inclusive) have diagonal cascades of five cities (e.g. Maurila through Euphemia in chapter 2). These five-city cascades are displaced by one theme column to the right as one proceeds to the next chapter. In order that the cascade sequence terminates (the book of cities is not infinite!) Calvino, in chapter 9, truncates the diagonal cascades in steps: Laudomia through Raissa is a cascade of four cities, followed by cascades of three, two, and one, necessitating ten cities in the final chapter. The same pattern is used in reverse in chapter 1 as the diagonal cascade of cities is born.  All I can conclude from reading this is that this might be why I did not like ""Invisible Cities"" as much as I expected and wanted to. Although I am Asian, I swear I am not good with mathematics, and all of the above still makes very little sense to me. Clearly, I am missing out on something that seems would add to the awesome level of the book of only I could properly grasp it, because I have always had a weakness when it comes to creative and original writing structures. To further prove this suspicion (that this is indeed a great book that I am personally missing out on), apparently ""Invisible Cities"" was the basis for an Opera that was a 2014 Pulitzer Prize finalist. And, like my lack of talent in mathematics, I again fail the Asian stereotype by not being able to read music; not to mention I have yet to aquire a predilection for Opera. Alas, while I did like reading the book, found it beautiful, poetic; could recognize the proficiency in the writing and the brilliance required to write such a novel, I found myself more lost than anything. I hate to admit, I even lost interest several times, losing track of what I had read and needing to turn back several pages. I do not like being lost, confused, perplexed, and aimless in mazes. Make sure to read this one as poetry. Since both books are written elegantly and evoke mesmerizing images, akin to painting pictures in the reader's eyes, it would only make sense to make this one last analogy. Alan Lightman's ""Einstein's Dreams"", one of my favorite books of all time, is like Monet, an impressionistic portrait of 30 cities where time of manipulated and relativity plays an important role. After reading each portrait, the reader is left thinking about the possibilities this creates; a million what if? scenarios accompanied by philosophical contemplations on why we do what we do and how much we take time, in its natural state, for granted; one might wonder how much we really know about time and consider the possibility that not everything is as it seems. Italo Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" is closer to a Pollock, a disarray of images and muddled imagery of 55 cities. Then again, is it 55 cities? Or 5? Or only the one, as the synopsis reads? Or maybe it is really of no city and all cities all at once. I am left with dreamy glimmers of fantasy worlds. Magnificent flashes of cities intricately designed, floating in the sky. Cities that have a copy of themselves underground for the afterlife. Cities where ""every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence"". Cities made of nothing but pipes, complete with floating girls in showers singing aloud. Cities master planned on alignment with the stars and the zodiac. Cities that fold in on themselves, that one can never find until they have already been wandering around it for hours. After reading these prose poems, readers are not left with any concrete possibilities to philosophize on, but emotions have definitely been aroused. Beautiful paintings, yes, but I tend to like a little more substance. And ""Einstein's Dreams"" had both. ""It is known that names of places change as many times as there are foreign languages, and that every place can be reached from other places, by the most various roads and routes, by those who ride, or drive, or row, or fly... Traveling, you realize that differences are lost, each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances; a shapeless cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact, that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name... ""  ""At times I feel as if your voice is reaching me from far away, while I am in an unlivable present, where all forms of society have reached an extreme of their cycle and there is no imagining what new forms they may assume. And I hear, from your voice, the invisible reasons which makes cities live, though which perhaps, once dead, they will come to life again.",2017-04-05 09:26:31,4,en,2017-04-05 09:26:31,4,2017,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00011,0.00017,0.00014,1726
Inderjit Sanghera,"Effervescent and elegiacal, Calvino’s ‘Invisible Cities’ explores Venice via the eyes of Marco Polo, who, in recounting the wonderful and extraordinary cities he has visited to Kublai Khan, is in fact different facets of one city; Venice. Writers allows us to see the world in different ways, and Calvino’s ‘Invisible Cities’ encapsulates this idea, transforming Venice into a multitude of different cities, though in turn Venice itself is symbolic of every city, which in turn are made up of a multitude of different cities, each with customs, buildings and people whose uniqueness beautify the city and the world.“The lake’s surface was barely wrinkled; the copper palace of the ancient palace of the Sung was shattered into sparkling glints like floating leaves.‘Memory’s images, once they are fixed into words, are erased’, Polo Said. ‘Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it,l little by little”Memory preserves, yet imagination transmogrifies the staleness of pure stale and static memory into something that is vibrant and vivid. Venice is both a single city and every city, the alchemy of memory and the imagination allow us transform the mundaneness of our past into something magical and mellifluous;“Not the labile mists of memory nor the dry transparence, but the charring of burned lives that forms a scab on the city, the sponge swollen with vital matter that no longer flows; the jam of past, present, future that blocks existences calcified in the illusion of the movement; this is what you will find at the end of journey.”Cities are as much about the inhabitants as the people and you will only discover true meaning of the city if you seek to explore the population who reside in the city; their cultures and customs, their pasts and futures and their lives which from the heady kaleidoscope upon which the city revolves and the endless choices which their lives bring; “Futures not achieved are only branches of the past; dead branches.”Calvino’s descriptions of Venice are nothing short of beautiful; he has gifted the traveller to Venice wide an array of beautiful and unique images of Venice; fabulous and fantastical, Calvino’s febrile imagination is one of the greatest triumphs and homages to the imagination in all literature;“Irene is the visible city where you lean out from the edge of the plateau at an hour when the lights come on, and in the limpid air, the pink of the settlement can be discerned out in the distance below: where the windows are more concentrated, where it thins out in dimly lit alleys, where it collects shadows of gardens, where it raises towers with signal fires; and if the evening is misty, a hazy glow swells like a milky sponge at the foot of the gulleys.”",2014-11-29 20:59:48,5,en,2014-11-29 20:59:48,11,2014,0.00127,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.0002,0.00018,471
Christopher,"A book written about cities that are invisible is a book seen from nowhere.""The eye does not see things but images of things that mean other things."" Most of our lives take place in language, so it's not as strange as it, at first, feels. It's just that we don't normally put things quite this way. Calvino, what have you done to me? I cannot build the structures I need here.""Kublai: Perhaps this dialogue of ours is taking place between two beggars nicknamed Kublai Khan and Marco Polo; as they sift through a rubbish heap, piling up rusted flotsam, scraps of cloth, wastepaper, drunk on the few sips of bad wine, they see all the treasure of the East shine around them.Polo: Perhaps all that is left of the world is a wasteland covered with rubbish heaps, and the hanging garden of the Great Khan's palace. It is our eyelids that separate them, but we cannot know which is inside and which outside.""The blurb for this book is misleading. It is only very loosely Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan about his world tour. I did not recognize the name of a single city that Polo ""described,"" but almost all of those he mentioned. Anachronisms abound. Khan accuses Polo of confabulation. Polo confesses to describing Venice over and over. But none of these are spoilers. In fact, this is a book you cannot spoil. So what is going on here? ""It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""Part of me wants to reach into the story and demystify the parable. To ask why choose Polo and Khan? To take the associations of ancient emperor and traveler and to assign them contemporary relevancies. To parse out the aphoristic architectures and to piece together cogent philosophies on the structures of civilizations. But I'd rather simply live in Raissa (p148-149). Writing about this text is self-defeating. It can only be appreciated as phenomena, the lived experience of you, reader. So stop with this poor floundering, and pick up the book. Enjoy what you see and all that you hear. ""Our perception ends in objects, and the object once constituted, appears as the reason for all the experiences of it which we have had or could have. For example, I see the next-door house from a certain angle, but it would be seen differently from the right bank of the Seine, or from the inside, or again from an aeroplane: the house itself is none of these appearances: it is, as Leibnitz said, the geometrized projection of these perspectives and of all possible perspectives, that is, the perspectiveless position from which all can be derived, the house seen from nowhere."" -M.

Arun Divakar,"For once, just for this once I agree with a review on the book cover. On the cover page of Invisible Cities is written a line by Sunday Times "" A subtle, beautiful meditation.."", the book lives up to these words in its 165 pages. This is my first Italo Calvino and I intend to find out from some place his acclaimed ""If on a winter's night.."".Unfolding as a dialog between the Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan &amp; the legendary explorer Marco Polo, the book is a dream like sojourn through a distant land( or should i say dream !)scapes. When the book began, I was trying to make sense of the names of the cities as Marco described them but then somewhere along the flow of the book the names of the cities did not matter. At some points it is the travel to reach the city that matters, at others it could be a street in the city that holds your attention &amp; at other times it could be the glimpse of a face at the window if just for a second ; these are the remembrances the book left me with. The cities that Marco Polo describes to the Emperor all maybe begin and end with the narrator's home : Venice. It is from a subtly vague remembrance of Venice that Marco might begin describing a tale. From this might branch the alleys, by lanes and streets of a distant city. Whether the city might be a dream or reality is something that is hinted in the book at many a place. The traveler takes the emperor through many a facet of the cities : through resplendent glory &amp; Opulence to death &amp; decay ; through cities built within cities &amp; alternate realities to crumbling dust of once glorious townships &amp; mazes of cities from which there is no return. Keeping Polo's descriptions aside, the insightful dialog that passes between the two are wonderful to say the least. One of those books where I never skipped through pages...there were too few to skip any way !!!Recommended to all those who would want a dreamy journey through imaginary landscapes of beauty &amp; grace...One of those wonderful lines in the book as said by Marco Polo when asked to describe Venice by the emperor :  Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased. Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it.

But no, I still don't see it.I appreciate the philosophical treatise, and understand what he's trying to convey (that the reader/ listener constructs the reality), but it was really quite tiresome by the end. While it contains some rather beautiful imagery and interesting concepts (i.e. man's interaction not only with the people around him, but also his surroundings).

Paloma,"Reseña en Español | Review in English
  “La ciudad no cuenta su pasado, lo contiene como las líneas de una mano, escrito en las esquinas de las calles, en las rejas de las ventanas.”
Llevo semanas dándole vueltas a cómo escribir una reseña sobre Las ciudades invisibles ya que, sencillamente, no encuentro las palabras. En ocasiones me atormento pensando que quizá estoy perdiendo la capacidad de escribir reseñas sobre libros que me han gustado muchísimo y me han impactado y es que muchas veces parece más fácil escribir un texto enumerando lo que no me gustó de un libro más que sus aciertos. Sin embargo, creo que la cuestión radica en que ningún texto de Calvino es fácil, porque no son historias tradicionales ni en trama ni en estructura. Porque leer a Calvino es despegarse de la tierra y de la realidad un rato y dejarse llevar por mundos y vericuetos de pronto mágicos, sublimes, pero con destellos de nuestra humanidad. Es abandonar la cotidianidad y dejar de buscar tramas lineales o conocidas; es permitirse disfrutar de la belleza de las palabras en la historia. No siempre es sencillo pero Calvino es un magnífico contador de historias: puedo no comprender cada detalle que incluye pero no importa, ya que las palabras son suficientes para continuar escuchando sobre estas ciudades. Muchos de nosotros buscamos en la lectura una forma de escape, una historia que nos permita evadirnos de nuestra realidad adentrándonos en la vida de otros. En este libro de Calvino encontramos esto, pero en gran medida creo que el protagonista es el lenguaje más que la trama. Cada frase es un mundo en sí mismo, lleno de riqueza y de eternidad. Incluso ahora pienso que, en esta primera lectura, quedé atrapada en una primera capa del texto, en el de las palabras que construyen estas ciudades lejanas, terribles, distantes pero que guardan un sin número de secretos y misterios. En mi mente encuentro leves trazos de las ciudades descritas en el texto, pero no las recuerdo con precisión. Creo que si fuera un personaje, sería sin duda Kublai Khan: encantada escuchando las historias de Marco Polo, fascinada por sus palabras pero haciendo un esfuerzo por concebir el vasto mundo dibujado en ellas, luchando por retener cada una de las anécdotas del viajero. Sin embargo, no obstante todo lo que falte comprender, cada historia, cada ciudad, cada espacio, vale la pena, porque en ella se encuentran deseos, pérdidas, esperanzas. Tal y como señala el autor en su prólogo:
   “Las ciudades invisibles son un sueño que nace del corazón de las ciudades invivibles (…) Las ciudades son un conjunto de muchas cosas: memorias, deseos, signos de un lenguaje; son lugares de trueque, como explican todos los libros de historia de la economía, pero estos trueques no lo son sólo de mercancías, son también trueques de palabras, de deseos, de recuerdos.” 
Este es, sin duda, un libro que merece varias relecturas para descubrir estas ciudades y quizá, poder encontrar una parte de nuestra alma o nuestros sueños en ellas. ______
  “The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps…”
For weeks, I have been thinking of how to write review for Invisible Cities and I still cannot find the words. My review will do this book no justice, and sometimes I fear I might have lost the capacity of writing about books I’ve loved and which have truly made an impact on me. At times it feels easier to write a rant about books which I did not like and all the negative things founds on them, rather than on books that are beautiful from start fo finish. I will excuse myself by saying that I believe that Calvino’s books are not easy to grasp, because they are not traditional stories –nor plot-wise nor in their structutre. Because reading Calvino is leaving reality behind and entering worlds and places full of magic, ethereal at times, but with glimpses here and there from our humanity. It is abandoning our daily life and stop looking for lineal or well-known stories; it is allowing oneself to enjoy of only the beauty in words, the beauty of language. This is not always easy, but Calvino is a magnificent story-teller: I might not fully comprehend every detail in the story but it will not matter, his words are enough for me to want to continue listening to these tales.It is true that most readers seek an escape to reality, or a story that allows to experience other realities and worlds through the lives of others. On this book we find this escape, but it is not through the plot or any specific character: the main character itself is language. Each sentence contains a world on its own, full of beauty and of eternity. Now that I think about it, I believe that my first read only allowed me to access the first layer of the text, and I feel mesmerized by the words that are the building blocks of these faraway, terrible, distant, magical cities, full of secrets and mysteries yet to be understood. In my mind I am able to find images here and there of the cities described by Calvino, but if you asked me for a specific detail, I would not be able to point out one. If I was a character in this story, I would definitely be Kublai Khan: mesmerized by Marco Polo, listening to his stories, but trying hard to truly grasp each anecdote about those places which I might never see in real life. However, and regardless of the many things to comprehend, each story, each city, each space, is valuable because there we find desires, hopes, loses. As Calvino indicated on the book’s prologue:
  “Invisible cities are a dream that comes from the heart of unlivable cities (…) Cities are a set of many things: memories, desires, signs of a language; they are places of barter, as all economic history books explain, but these barters are not only exchanges of goods, they are also exchanges of words, desires, and memories.” 
This is one of those books that deserves a reread, to continue discovering those cities and maybe, find a part of our souls or our dreams in them.",2020-12-19 09:45:13,4,en,2020-12-19 09:45:13,12,2020,0.01292,0.00017,0.00135,0.00033,0.00062,0.00038,1066
Paul,"A pair of stoned dudes sits around, imagining possible worlds. And then the thought occurs to them; are they just a pair of mendicants sorting through the rubbish on the city tip? Shot through with the author's characteristic wit and levity, Invisible Cities adds another masterwork to Calvino's œuvre. He dreams for us so that we can share his visions. And so, Marco Polo returns from his explorations to report to the emperor, Kublai Khan, furnishing him with fabulous descriptions of cities that never were and never can be, fleshing out his accounts with mundane details that are never mundane and musings on ambition and mortality. Invisible Cities was written shortly after Calvino moved to Paris and was admitted to the Oulipo. It's no coincidence, then, that mathematics lie behind the construction of the book, just as they did in Perec's magnum opus, Life a User's Manual. I found a PhD thesis online that examines this aspect of the composition which is a quarter as long again as Calvino's book! There's no space to go into that here. Part of the fun is to think back and choose your favourite cities. Zenobia, the city on stilts; Armilla, the city of which only the plumbing and sanitary fittings remain, inhabited now by water nymphs; Octavia ""the spider-web city"", hanging above a precipice ('the life of Octavia's inhabitants is less uncertain than in other cities. They know the net will last only so long')... We're spoilt for choice. How about you? Assuming you're not among the nay-sayers here, which would you select? Procopia - ""I raise the curtain, the window frames only an expanse of faces..."" Gormley installation in Colchester, 2020All of the jaded, parody reviews above this one serve only to illustrate the beauty of Calvino's surrealist poetry. They bring to mind the enfeebled versions of the cities the writer sometimes describes. Come, ladies and gentlemen, raise your game. Calvino pricks his own bubble with the Polo-Khan interludes. Find a better angle of attack for your rubber arrows. Inject your satire with a little of the wit and originality that Calvino's work possesses. I think it was my recommendation of this short piece to a book club that made me finally renounce such groups forever (or it might have been The Spire - I forget which, but the reaction was the same). I should have known better, of course. Apparently, Invisible Cities is pretentious nonsense. Yes, it's that lazy, middlebrow label for anything that aspires beyond the norm. We live in an age where poetry is something about which we ought to feel vaguely ashamed or embarrassed. I suspect it's the suspicion that you think it makes you clever for reading it that goads the book club member. Erm, no, clearly Calvino is the clever one here; his reader merely clings to his coattails for the duration of the journey. ""Reading group novel"". That's actually now a category used by the ""industry"" (another term that tells you all you need to know). Oh dear. It's worse than that, though. Not only are you in danger of being labelled a ""pseud"" merely for being seen carrying a copy of the book... nothing happens in it. There's no story (obviously, the stories of the fifty-five cities described don't count). Where is Calvino's imagination? There, there, Momma's gonna read you 'Harry Potter', even though you're a 47 year old banking auditor. I actually have no problem with people who want to read a ripping yarn (or should that be a rip-off yarn in the case just mentioned?) What rattles against the oxidated bars of my gilded cage is the suggestion that a book can be nothing more.Calvino's metaphysical comedy speaks best for itself:POLO: Unless porters, stonecutters, rubbish collectors, cooks cleaning the lights of chickens, washerwomen bent over stones, mothers stirring rice as they nurse their infants, exist only because we think them.KUBLAI: To tell the truth, I never think them. POLO: Then they do not exist.KUBLAI: To me this conjecture does not seem to suit our purposes. Without them we could never remain here swaying, cocooned in our hammocks.POLO: Then the hypothesis must be rejected. The other hypothesis is true: they exist and we do not.KUBLAI: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be.Ha ha!",2020-04-10 20:15:12,5,en,2020-04-10 20:15:12,4,2020,0.05399,0.00028,0.00332,0.00032,0.00672,0.00164,715

Tom,"This book is beautiful. I can't review it, but i can give it a tribute. Here's my attempt at my own Invisible City:Across the sea and four days south, you reach the city of Desiree. From miles away, you see its peaked cathedral forced into the horizon. Yet the nearer you come to its ancient walls, the smaller it becomes. It disappears behind houses, peeks around corners, sometimes you see it barely breaking the fence line of a garden, but it is always there, and it becomes dearer to you as you arrive. Upon your entry, you suddenly feel yourself dwarfed by Desiree. Its cobbled streets, its shouting food vendors and markets, its coffee shops, they all surround you and ask you, politely, to think of them as form of payment. You do, and now there is less of you. The alleys and woodland roads lead you to temples where kind priests tell you of gods that will only ask for you to think of them, and through your thinking, you shall form new gods and they shall think for themselves in the minds of others. Now there is more of you, yet it is, and forever shall be, elsewhere. As you drink and talk to the women of Desiree, you see that lovers here do not meet in bars or public places but in conscience and conversation. More like songs, they talk in tones. One lover follows upon one another’s rhythm, reverberating with each similarity and splicing from each motif. They dance with their words and turn with phrases until a harmony is formed, and from it, the song goes elsewhere to a private place where the lovers finish their song in bright light, or let it forget itself in the same way the string frays at the end of its tuning wheel. At times I found myself weaving in and out of Desiree’s market stalls. Within and without the sellers and shops, I found other thoughts stuck inside the mortar of Desiree’s ancient walls. “Do you still think of me?” “Strawberries, £2 for a kilo.” “fourteen years on the street for a year to be with you again.”“I hung here for five hours in the early October morning before the police come to take me down.”“The trains keep testing me, pushing.” “Always, but did that ever matter?” These thoughts, you realise are not from others, nor are they your own. They belong to the cathedral. Now you are within its walls, it is within you as are you within it. Each thought is within itself as much as an ouroboros is within and without itself. Your eyes see the form of the walls of Desiree, yet you feel it to be your skin on muscle and you cannot separate yourself from itself. Nor can it from you. Then one day you are bereft of its walls. Its cathedral leaves the horizon before you can see its farewell. It hides its roof in fear for where you are going next, but you cannot look away from the incoming time, for you do not know what you see.",2019-10-11 05:48:07,5,en,2019-10-11 05:48:07,10,2019,0.00348,0.0001,0.00026,0.00014,0.00028,0.00021,518
Indran Fernando,"This isn't a novel, nor a collection of short stories, though it's closer to the latter. I found it to be a beautifully poetic sort of prose. More specifically: prose that reminds me of my favorite poems of Neruda's. If Neruda were more of a trickster...Another point of reference is the mind-bending short stories of Borges--but Calvino doesn't let his interest in the metaphysical sap his writing's approachableness and sense of fun. If it starts to seem slightly philosophical at times, the effect is only to dazzle and enchant, not to cause a migraine. On nearly every page, I had an uncanny feeling as if Calvino had specially designed this for my particular sense of humor. When I heard that there was a 300+ page novel about a kid who refuses to come down from a tree, I thought the idea would quickly wear out its welcome. Calvino proved me wrong in the best way possible... And yet I was still skeptical that he could hold my attention with 160 pages of very brief descriptions of imaginary cities—maybe Baron in the Trees was a fluke? Wrong again.For a time, I had anticipated that I would remember my 2020 reading habits in terms of authors like Adolfo Bioy Casares, Nawal El Saadawi, David Foster Wallace or Mikhail Bulgakov—but as things currently stand, it's more likely to be Italo Calvino.Excerpt:""What makes Argia different from other cities is that it has earth instead of air. The streets are completely filled with dirt, clay packs the rooms to the ceiling, on every stair another stairway is set in negative, over the roofs of the houses hang layers of rocky terrain like skies with clouds. We do not know if the inhabitants can move about the city, widening the worm tunnels and the crevices where roots twist: the dampness destroys people's bodies and they have scant strength; everyone is better off remaining still, prone; anyway, it is dark.""From up here, nothing of Argia can be seen; some say, 'It's down there,' and we can only believe them.

Joseph,"I can't clean my house or do the dishes or exercise w/o listening to a book. If I don't, it starts to feel like I'm wasting my time. One day I cleaned my house while listening this book and drinking beer. Excited to read my first Calvino, this short book narrated by the amazing John Lee grabbed me.I had a great time. Though this book was a translation from Calvino's original Italian, I can comfortably say that I like the way this man talks. And I felt right at home eavesdropping on his two characters conversations. It was just very enjoyable listening to these two men talk through the conduit of John Lee's beautiful articulations. My knowledge of world history is embarrassingly deficient so I really didn't know much about the actual Khan and Polo going in, but I would like to go drinking with Calvino's Khan and Polo. (Which, I suppose I kind of did.)I love the fantasy genre and world-building and poetry so I was instantly drawn to Polo's descriptions of all 55 of ""the cities."" Overall this was a great read/experience.As follows is my favorite passage. I'm a sucker for chess.[...The Great Khan tried to concentrate on the game: but now it was the game's purpose that eluded him. Each game ends in a gain or a loss: but of what? What were the true stakes? At checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner's hand, a black or a white square remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire's multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness. Then Marco Polo spoke: ""Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in a year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night's frost forced it to desist."" Until then the Great Khan had not realized that the foreigner knew how to express himself fluently in his language, but it was not this fluency that amazed him. ""Here is a thicker pore: perhaps it was a larvum's nest; not a woodworm, because, once born, it would have begun to dig, but a caterpillar that gnawed the leaves and was the cause of the tree's being chosen for chopping down . . . This edge was scored by the wood carver with his gouge so that it would adhere to the next square, more protruding."" The quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood overwhelmed Kublai; Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows . . .]*** A comment on the audiobook ***I love watching/listening to humans that have absolutely mastered their trade, be it plumbing, piano-playing, woodworking, cheese-making, glassblowing or what have you. John Lee has mastered his craft. I could listen to him narrate a thick sheaf of papers littered with legal jargon.

Liza Fireman,"Can you read a book and understand every chapter but still not understand the book as a whole? This is how I felt here. Calvino is writing beautifully about imagined cities, and still I was left unconnected. The settings are beautiful and captivating. But somehow I became bored. The story was missing. And all the imagination and descriptions did not cover up for this.So if I wished to describe Aglaura to you, sticking to what I personally saw and experienced, I should have to tell you that it is a colourless city, without character, planted there at random. But this would not be true, either: at certain hours, in certain places along the street, you see opening before you the hint of something unmistakable, rare, perhaps magnificent; you would like to say what it is, but everything previously said of Aglaura imprisons your words and obliges you to repeat rather than say.The writing style might be a bit too poetic to my liking. I appreciate the philosophical aspects, but maybe it is just not for me. Maybe it is not true, and for certain people it is rare, perhaps magnificent.

Edward,"I often wonder just how big an effect timing has on my enjoyment of a book. Whether if by just slightly altering the variables of mood, expectation, tiredness, state of mind (etc), a book could move in my estimation from mediocre to great (or vice versa).Invisible Cities is a book I should love. It's original, very imaginative, poetic, and unlike anything I've read before. I can't help but think that if I had read it at another time I would have enjoyed it more. But for now, it just wasn't what I needed - it felt too light and insubstantial. Which is unfair, because despite its size it's not that at all.

Canon,"KUBLAI: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be. POLO: And here, in fact, we are. According to Benedict Anderson, the ""unselfconscious coherence"" of the great religiously imagined communities began to wane ""steadily after the late Middle Ages,"" (Imagined Communities 16). For Anderson, one of the main drivers of this waning was ""the effect of the explorations of the non-European world, which mainly but by no means exclusively in Europe 'abruptly widened the cultural and geographic horizon and hence also men's conception of possible forms of human life.'"" As an example of this modern ""territorialization of faiths"" with its resulting religious self-consciousness and incipient relativism, Anderson cites Marco Polo's ""awed description"" of Kublai Khan in his phenomenal (must-read) Travels:The grand khan, having obtained this signal victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to the capital city of Kanbalu. This took place in the month of November, and he continued to reside there during the months of February and March, in which latter was our festival of Easter. Being aware that this was one of our principal solemnities, he commanded all the Christians to attend him, and to bring with them their Book, which contains the four Gospels of the Evangelists.If Polo's travelogue can be set as a landmark within the advent of modernity, Calvino's delightful text, which reimagines the encounter between Polo and Kublai, speaks from a decidedly postmodern context. Intervening in the imperial ennui of Kublai, who has reached that moment in the lives of emperors ""which follows pride in the boundless extension of the territories we have conquered,"" Polo describes fifty-five cities from his travels so that Kublai might understand his empire: ""In the Khan's mind the empire was reflected in a desert of labile and interchangeable data, like grains of sand, from which there appeared, for each city and province, the figures evoked by the Venetian's logogriphs."" Polo's fantastic, glorious cities are intricately grouped under eleven thematic categories: Cities &amp; Memory, Cities &amp; Desire, Cities &amp; Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities &amp; Eyes, Cities &amp; Names, Cities &amp; the Dead, Cities &amp; the Sky, Continuous Cities, and Hidden Cities — yet, we eventually learn from Polo that ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice."" Indeed, the very conversations of Kublai &amp; Polo, their understanding of one another and of the many cities of Kublai's empire, are, like the cities themselves in their ""thick coating of signs,"" insubstantial, dreamlike, mere remembrances and possibilities:That is to say, between the two of them it did not matter whether questions and solutions were uttered aloud or whether each of the two went on pondering in silence. In fact, they were silent, their eyes half-closed, reclining on cushions, swaying in hammocks, smoking long amber pipes... Kuhlai Khan interrupted him or imagined interrupting him, or Marco Polo imagined himself interrupted, with a question such as, ""You advance always with your head turned hack?"" or ""Is what you see always behind you?"" or rather, ""Does your journey take place only in the past?"" All this so that Marco Polo could explain or imagine explaining or be imagined explaining or succeed finally in explaining to himself that what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveler's past changes according to the route he has followed.This is a radiant, humorous, poignant little work, which reminds us that our reality, our cities and their histories, are not inexorable: ""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""",2022-01-09 00:41:54,4,en,2022-01-09 00:41:54,1,2022,0.00079,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,695
Justin Labelle,"Calvino's Invisible Cities is a true masterwork.It is a beautifully crafted novel of ideas and conversations that are both conceptually sound and sublimely written.The novel as a whole, consists of a prolonged conversation, think Arabian Nights, where two protagonists, Marco Polo and the Khan, discuss and describe at length, various cities in their physical and metaphysical states of being. To go into more detail is to take away from the sheer pleasure of discovery. Strongly recommended and a new addition to my personal Top 10 list. Memorable lines, (No spoilers but some conclusions to the description of cities may be found below) :'Desires are already memories''The city appears to you as a whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit this desire and be content''Your gaze scans the streets as if they were written pages: the city says everything you must think, makes you repeat her discourse, and while you believe you are visiting Tamara you are only recording the names with which she defines herself and all her parts''Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city can begin to exist''My gaze is that of a man meditating, lost in thought- I admit it. But yours? You cross archipelagos, tundras, mountain ranges. You would do as well never moving from here.''The more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there''You advance always with your head turned back? or Is what you see always behind you? or rather, does your journey take place only in the past?''The traveller's pas changes according to the route he has followed'The foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places''Marcoenters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man's place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square.''Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.''if existence in all its moments is all of itself, Zoe is the place of indivisible existence''Cities, like reams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else''Falsehood is never in words; it is in things''Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,"" Polo said.""Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.''You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.''the form of things can be discerned better at a distance''The world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end. Only the name of the airport changes.''Travelling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents.

Kathryn,"Invisible Cities began as an interesting idea, but it quickly bored me and I had a terrible time finishing. Reminiscent of Scheherazade, Marco Polo relays to Kublai Khan his impressions of the cities he has visited, hopes to visit, or imagines visiting in the future. Khan realizes during the dialogues, interspersed between the descriptions of the cities, that each of the cities are alike in all of their differences and that the possibilities are endless. The idea is quite romantic, as is most of the book. The settings are beautiful and numerous, captivating at times, shocking at times. I am still wondering why I became bored. I guess the book lacked purpose. It also walked too much between poetry and novel, lacking the characteristics of a novel as well as too much prose being present when I wanted something more poetic. I thought the entire purpose of the book was evident early on. I continued to read only to see what new and imaginative settings Calvino would introduce. The descriptions reminded me of what I tended to write when I was ten, such as women walking pumas, cities of weird angles, and cities within cities. The book was akin to reading the detailed map provided at the beginning of a high-fantasy epic novel. The setting was interesting but the story missing. Another thing I did not like about this book was the intrusion of the present day. When Calvino mentioned refridgerators and airports, the book felt less magical. I did not welcome present day technologies in Polo's descriptions. I thought at first that I would be making high recommendations of the book to people who enjoy travelling, who enjoy looking at their world through new eyes, and I can still do this, but I will warn that the reader better be in need of a slow paced and simplistic book. My favorite passages were Cities and the Dead. These were interesting and not as light and airy as some of the others. In the end, I felt little if any connection to the book and I doubt I will read more by the author.",2011-06-11 10:16:37,2,en,2011-06-11 10:16:37,6,2011,0.0006,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,354
Steven,"""And Polo said: 'The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.

(165)In Invisible Cities, Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are siting in the latter's garden; the traveller Polo tells the emperor of the cities that comprise his vast empire. They all turn out to be the same city, or rather parts of the same city, or rather memories of cities, or rather blueprints of cities that could potentially be. The concept of Invisible Cities is fascinating, and I loved several of the short descriptions of the cities (a couple in particular were brilliant). Others weren't as strong or compelling, which is excusable, I suppose, since it must be difficult to successfully differentiate and make persuasive 55 would-be cities through short descriptions. The dialogue between Khan and Polo was the real problem for me, however. Around this talk the story is framed, and while it has its moments of interest, it mostly dealt in a kind of pseudo-profundity, a too-often fluffy sort of New Age babble. For example: ""Polo: …Perhaps the terraces of this garden overlook only the lake of our mind…"" I have very little patience for this sort of stuff, and it jarred the dialogue too frequently for me to either ignore or excuse it. All in all, then, Invisible Cities had its moments, but was—ultimately—more beautifully conceived than executed.",2017-06-07 19:44:50,3,en,2017-06-07 19:44:50,6,2017,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,312
Rosana,"As a child I remember being mesmerized by a collection of fairy tales. I could read with proficiency for my age – maybe 6 or 7 – but much of the meaning escaped me, although I could sense, or guess, much of it. At the end, it did not matter, because I was enthralled by the images and language. Invisible Cities took me back to that early reading experience. I felt lost at times, searching for the meaning when the surreal and exotic images made me drunk. There is a philosophical deepness to this book, which is very elusive: almost impossible to grasp, just glimpse. Yet, at moments, it surprisingly takes form and content with obvious clarity.

Mark Moorman,"I would recommend this book to readers who like to think. I am tempted to say to readers trained in philosophy except that this is a book that begins and ends in wonder, a book with no answers and in which, perhaps, the very idea of seeking an answer is lampooned. Yet, it is thought provoking and seems to offer partial insights into the human condition, each one, burst like a rising balloon by a pin prick of humor or absurdity. The book is NOT some exercise in literary theory that only some effete audience of ""intellectuals"" would pretend to appreciate; it draws the reader in, and captivates him or her with beauty. Calvino enraptures as Scheherazade does in the Arabian Nights, and the book has this kind of aura about it. The book is ostensibly Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan of far off cities he has visited. These are impossible cities of the imagination, both in themselves and temporally (airports are spoken of for example). It becomes a kind of metaphysical debate---theories of time are offered and exemplified, a solipsistic Cartesian haze hangs over the dialogue---that everything is in their minds, or in the discourse, or the fumes from their pipes. Their languid conversation in the gardens of the Khan are the Neo-Platonic reality and the cities described mere ephemeral appearances. Yet each city is really only Polo's memory of some aspect of Venice--the city never directly spoken of. Many twisting games are played with possibility and necessity--the Great Khan will describe the cities first and Polo will say if and where they exist, or perhaps they can deduce the cities from first principles. Complicated, and what is the point of all this, besides the point that we should not seek points? I hazard some guesses. (1) Calvino shows that one can create a beautiful story even when so much of the underlying narrative is contradictory and irrational. (2) This can be done even with no unifying subject at the center of the narrative---we have just the twin protagonists Kublai Khan and Polo and an implied 3rd person narrator. (3) What struck me most was that this was an anti-existentialist novel. In popular jargon it was said that the essence of existentialism is that ""existence comes before essence"" and the task was to root art in the ""real"" individuality of lived existence. Here essence, essences spun out of pure imagination and will, come before existence--- which is never really reached at all. The invisible, in most cases not just unseen but impossible, is shown via a kind of metaphysical, speculative dialogue. Essence precedes existence, and Calvino may be hinting that this kind of creative violence is always/ already at work even in the so-called realist novel.",2018-07-13 01:09:27,5,en,2018-07-13 01:09:27,7,2018,0.00081,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,457
Sidharth Vardhan,"This book is so incredibly beautiful, that I felt like just giving it a five star speechless review. Than I remembered all the likes I stood to miss out, that way. Therfore I take shelter in that old saying 'Imitation is the best form of flattery':
  Changing cities
For good or for bad, you will never forget your first visit to the garden city ‘Raag’ - yes, you must have heard about it, people talk about it all the time. It is a strange city, you can’t direct anyone to it, it can only be discovered accidentally, and discovered only when you are looking for it in pairs. It is only in pairs that you are allowed entry, for it is a city of pairs. The butterflies, sparrows and squirrels are all only to be found in pairs. Even the flowers smiling to sunlight have their faces close together in pairs as if whispering secrets to each other. Raag's popularity with poets has made it so attractive to people that everywhere one finds people wandering around in pairs specifically, though often also secretly, looking for it.Though, at times found after a great wait and though it is often advised otherwise, the travelers who reach it often seem to be in a rush to explore it at once. May be it is just the excitement at the sight of city’s impossible beauty – even though the very objects that make the city are most commonplace; it makes travellers behave in new ways with their fellow partners. As if under a spell - needless to say a magical one; glances are stolen, smiles returned, promises made, secrets and kisses shared … and before you know it, you and your co-traveler are building your house in the woods by the lake; resolving never to leave. For what could be better than this joy that seems to promise to never die!Except some of them leave – because one can’t bear the excitement or because, stupid as it obviously is, one wants to travel on. Those whose co-travellers have left, must leave too – or find a dark corner in a city that can find beauty only in pairs.Soon those who had left want to return to Raag. And they do come back with a new co-traveler this time – but the city is no longer there. The woods, flowers, butterflies, sparrows, squirrels and lake are still there and the same; you even recognize that house which you build with your own hands – but the city, it no longer inspires that old ecstasy. You know the convention – the promises, the smiles, the kisses … but now it doesn't come naturally; at times you are unable go though it. You rush away wondering whether you were deceived first time, or if you have lost your way this time. You find yourself leaving the city, shaking your head in refusal to see that city is still same – and, may be, even already thinking of trying to find Raag somewhere else or perhaps already realizing that you will rather live in denial than admit the truth – that the city is still the same, that it is you who have changed.",2015-07-06 15:00:00,5,en,2015-07-06 15:00:00,7,2015,0.00295,0.0001,0.00025,0.00013,0.00027,0.0002,536
Jerry Jose,"Marco Polo who seems high af while visiting Kublai Khan, goes sycophant explaining all those imaginary cities he believes to have visited. All of them are exquisitely beautiful, eloquently expressed, named after madchens and never undergone any vicissitudes of life as such. There were many sumptuous cities with beautiful amorous girls throwing themselves at the travelers, and ones where inhabitants circled their home, work, wife when things got boring. After listening to quite a few of his Utopian cities, the rather lethargic Mr. Khan, presumably high on the same stuff as Mr.Polo, goes on expressing Cities off his head, asking Mr.Polos confirmation on the existence of his imagination. Mr. Polo having already wared plenty of his punctilious imagination, at last succumbs to the existence of Mr. Khans creation, embellishing with details of his visit. At some point when he is asked of Venice, he says every city he explained is Venice, the beauty of which perplexes him. Also Calvino seems lost in his imagination, leaving some timeline anomalies which are least bothered to be expunged. Mr. Polo goes all philosophical, maybe at the pinnacle of stuff moment, says everything he explained might be this town called Irene, which is different every time visited. Though this book feels like Ship of Theseus in its path to 55 cities, you find it hard to put down. This is like Prophet or Little Prince for knack-packers, and no matter how much you make fun of the whole thing, you are left gobsmacked by its invigorous grandeur.",2016-04-27 00:10:51,3,en,2016-04-27 00:10:51,4,2016,0.008,0.00012,0.00049,0.00017,0.0006,0.00032,253
Stian,"Probably the most creative travelogue ever, this is a brilliant excursion into human imagination. Somehow, I felt memories from every place I've ever visited come flowing back to me while reading this. I visited Dubrovnik last October, and my memories of it became more vivid than ever. I stopped every now and then to digest what I'd read, and that's when the memories came. I think there's some message here too about how everything is possible and that we create the world we live in and we are able to change it -- for the better. The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension; seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.This reminded me of a Rubái of Omar Khayyam, translated by Richard Le Gallienne, which is also possibly my favourite Rubái: To all of us the thought of heaven is dear--Why not be sure of it and make it here?No doubt there is a heaven yonder too,But 'tis so far away--and you are near.",2015-05-04 03:12:38,3,en,2015-05-04 03:12:38,5,2015,0.00132,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00017,248

It is more of a strange take on metaphysics than anything else. Sometimes the descriptions get bogged down in strung-out adjectives and abstract sketches.

Soula Kosti,"Marco Polo visits Kublai Khan at the emperor’s garden and narrates to him details and stories about all the places he’s visited in his journeys. Each city belongs in a separate category (my favorite was Cities &amp; The Dead) and as his stories unfold, the more they feel like folktales, the more the cities appear as fictional ones. Invisible cities is a relatively short book but not a fast read as each essay contains numerous details about each city and some are more interesting than others. Overall, I had a great time with this and it felt like a journey back in time when we were young and through stories we were made to believe that everything is possible. Italo Calvino also included quite a few metaphors and allegories in his stories making it interesting for the reader to look for the deeper meanings behind his words. I also got Paulo Coelho vibes. “The more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities , the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there…… what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveler’s past changes according to the route he has followed……Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer posses lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places……By now from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.”",2021-12-15 03:46:29,4,en,2021-12-15 03:46:29,12,2021,0.00066,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,318
Quiver,"If you open Cities unaware of its form, you will be surprised. Calvino was one of the founding members of the Oulipo literary movement, whose proponents introduce mathematical schemes into their writing for fun and entertainment, and Cities is a product of one such scheme.The book consists of fifty-five chapters divided into nine parts, where each chapter’s title is derived from one of eleven names together with a number from one to five. Inevitably the mind will seek a pattern, for the naming convention is not linear in the obvious sense: for example, Cities &amp; Desire 1 is followed by Cities &amp; Memory 3, and Cities &amp; Signs 2 is followed by Thin Cities 1, and so on. You can find the pattern tabulated on the Wikipedia page, though it’d be a shame to spoil the pleasure of working it out for yourself by looking at the contents, if and when you decide to read the book.The chapter names—given here in order of appearance—hint at the topics touched upon: Cities &amp; Memory, Cities &amp; Desire, Cities &amp; Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities &amp; Eyes, Cities &amp; Names, Cities &amp; the Dead, Cities &amp; the Sky, Continuous Cities, Hidden Cities. An element that often creeps up is symmetry, that of sky and earth, youth and old age, life and death, outside the mirror and inside it.Here is a condensed interpretation of the cities in Part IV:<em>Cities &amp; Signs 5</em> - Olivia - a city where words are faithful signs.<em>Thin Cities 4</em> - Sophronia - a city of two halves, one permanent (a rollercoaster park), one impermanent (made of marble).<em>Trading Cities 3</em> - Eutropia - a city of many cities, like a chessboard of many squares where the people are like a single chess piece residing on one square at a time; when they get bored, they hop to another square-city, permuting jobs, wives, views.<em>Cities &amp; Eyes 2</em> - Zermude - a city whose form takes shape from the beholder’s mood (looking up or down).<em>Cities &amp; Names 1</em> - Aglaura - a colourful city that maintains its image (consisting of names) at the cost of its colourless, nameless actual existence. Each of the nine parts of the book is framed by a brief vignette into the meta-story: that of Venetian explorer Marco Polo reporting to Kublai Kahn the state of his empire. Each of the cities is meant to be one that Marco Polo travelled to, experienced, and is now bringing alive with words and gestures for the emperor’s pleasure. It is not clear to me where the greater depth lies—in the variety of the cities and the dimensions of being and society that are probed through them, or in the conversations between the two men, taking place in a magnolia garden across a chessboard.The following excerpt is taken from the meta-story (it can be found on p. 18 of this edition, bookending Part I). The commentary in-between the block quotes is my own.
  Newly arrived and totally ignorant of the Levantine languages, Marco Polo could express himself only with gestures, leaps, cries of wonder and of horror, animal barkings, or hootings, or with objects he took from his knapsacks—ostrich plumes, pea-shooters, quartzes—which he arranged in front of him like chessmen. Returning from the missions on which Kublai sent him, the ingenious foreigner improvised pantomimes that the sovereign had to interpret: one city was depicted by the leap of a fish, escaping the cormorant’s beak to fall into a net; another city by a naked man running through fire unscorched; a third by a skull, its teeth green with mold, clenching a round, while pearl.
To whom belongs the empire? To the man who has travelled it and mapped its lands with the soles of his feet and with the senses of his soul, or to the man who has conquered the borders and needs to be told of the cities that lie within?A completely different track of thought: Two strangers that meet always speak in pantomimes, be they beggars or kings.
  The Great Khan deciphered the signs, but the connection between them and the places visited remained uncertain; he never knew whether Marco wished to enact an adventure that had befallen him on his journey, an exploit of the city’s founder, the prophecy of an astrologer, a rebus or a charade to indicated a name.
What binds the cities of one land? Is it the people? Is it their location? Is the binding arbitrary so long as we pick one?
  But, obscure or obvious as it might be, everything Marco displayed had the power of emblems, which, once seen, cannot be forgotten or confused. In the Khan’s mind the empire was reflected in a desert of labile and interchangeable data, like grains of sand, from which there appeared, for each city and province, the figures evoked by the Venetian’s logogriphs.
All of life is reflected in our minds, grain for grain, city for city, in brain cell and thought.
  As the seasons passed and his missions continued, Marco mastered the Tartar language and the national idioms and tribal dialects. Now his accounts were the most precise and detailed that the Great Khan could wish and there was no question or curiosity that they did not satisfy. And yet each piece of information about a place recalled to the emperor’s mind that first gesture or object with which Marco had designated the place. The new fact received a meaning from that emblem and also added to the emblem a new meaning. Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms.
  
  
  “On the day when I know all the emblems,” he asked Marco, “shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?”
  
  
  And the Venetian answered: “Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.”

Olivia-Savannah ,"This was a very experimental and different kind of read? It has been translated from Italian to English. Because it is so experimental, I don’t think this is one that will work for everyone. I quite liked the underlying messages about people, capitalism and the way we visit a city differently when we live there vs as a tourist. However, it did get repetitive sometimes. It was a short and quick read, but not one that is going to be memorable. It’s just unique in its experimentalist form. I also find this to be one that is difficult to describe, but it’s a man describing different cities to an Emperor. But every city is just a different way of describing the same one.This review and others can be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: https://oliviascatastrophe.com/2019/0...",2019-09-02 20:22:49,3,en,2019-09-02 20:22:49,9,2019,0.00059,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,133
Jonathan Terrington,"By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire's multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness...
  
If this quote alone does not highlight that Invisible Cities is a work of existentialist literature I doubt that nothing else will. In a similar vein of writing to If On a Winter's Night a Traveller Italo Calvino creates another beautifully written exploration of a metaphysical concept. This concept revolves around the relationship between cities and humanity and further, deeper, into the core of how appearance, memory and desire shape the reality of the world around us. To quote from The Truman Show: ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented."" And yet there is always someone who refuses to accept an all encompassing viewpoint or value as truth. This is what this novel is about.As mentioned, Calvino's writing is incredibly elegant and each short snippet of description, detailing a city, is poignantly lyrical. It is clear from the start that this work really has no true beginning or end but rather is about the expansion of horizons and the central point of our reality. It is the story of Kublai Khan as he gazes over his empire with imperial dignity, ruling over the near-providential increase of his empire. Yet it is also the story of Marco Polo, explorer of strange lands and the man who tells stories of these strange lands - strange cities - to Kublai Khan. It is the stories of Marco Polo which lead to Kublai Khan desiring to add these mystical locations to his domain, and herein claim them as his, yet as the stories continue, it becomes clear that the point is not for the Khan to own these cities, but for him to appreciate the lessons they have to share.
  
    ""You can resume your flight whenever you like,"" they said to me, ""but you will arrive at another Trude, absolutely the same, detail by detail. The world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end. Only the name of the airport changes.""""
  
There are several categories to each city written about by Calvino, as spoken by Marco Polo. There are cities of desire, cities of memory, thin cities, hidden cities, trading cities, cities and names, cities and the dead, cities and eyes, cities and signs, cities and the sky... Each category repeated at least once as it to make the point that the most important thing about each city is that it follows a categorical point, that there is nothing new under the sun no matter how obscure each city feels. In this Calvino's pondering and questioning about language, literature and reality are present if not quite visible...All this mentioned, Invisible Cities is not a book I could recommend to every reader. It is a book that I would recommend to help with your ability to think or write and even read, but it is not a book of leisure. You need to think as you read this book, to be thoughtfully processing and devouring each idea and city as you go in order not to merely 'like' the aesthetic but to understand the message. So, this warning aside, I would very much encourage the philosophical reader to investigate this work.",2012-09-30 16:07:48,4,en,2012-09-30 16:07:48,9,2012,0.00085,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,575

Richard,"From reading other reviews posted here (beautifully written many of them, but also very…well, vague) it’s clear no one has the faintest idea what this book is about. So I reckon my theory is as good as any.    Invisible Cities is short (c. 100 pages of actual text), with no plot, action or characters to speak of. Ostensibly, Marco Polo is describing to the Tartar emperor Kublai Khan some of the bizarre cities he’s supposedly passed through on his travels. The lack of a story doesn’t bother me (I like that sort of thing) but I did find it surprisingly unimaginative, compared to Calvino’s own Cosmicomics say—if these really are just invented cities here, I could probably make a more imaginative job of that myself. So they’re meant to represent something else, and there are also plenty of broad hints that this isn’t to be taken too seriously either. For example, these “cities” all have female names (Esmeralda, Olivia, Dorothea) and some of the potted descriptions include modern things: refrigerators, bulldozers, radios.    So what, looking back decades later, would someone like Marco Polo really remember most fondly about his travels? Towns and cities, sure, the landscapes too—dramatic mountain ranges, deserts and mighty rivers; he’d remember chieftains and emperors, stuffy unhelpful bureaucrats. But he was in the prime of his life (seventeen when he set off from Venice, forty-one when he returned), built like a boxing champion, but intelligent with it, cultured and very good looking. More, every town he passed through, across the entire width of Asia and back, he was the exotic-looking foreigner. Cities? That’s ridiculous. It’s the hundreds of women he met along the way he’d remember: energetic ones, puzzling ones, some he’s regretted leaving behind ever since, others he wishes he’d never met in the first place… (“A voluptuous vibration constantly stirs Chloe, the most chaste of cities…” “Many are the cities like Phyllis, which elude the gaze of all, except the man who catches them by surprise…” “Those who look down from the heights wonder if it would be pleasant or unpleasant to be in Irene that evening…”). Asia is seven thousand miles across—I’m surprised Polo had any energy left for travelling.    One of the main features of Italo Calvino’s books is the humour, and the only real question with this one is of who exactly he was getting a rise out of. Us, his readers? Probably not. Historians then? Maybe. Or all those deadly earnest literary types who pore over his work and talk complete crap about it at dinner parties? Ah yes, warmer there I think. His books are beautifully written, and with genuine originality, but he was also the sort of author who found it impossible to keep a straight face, ever, and you take his writing seriously at your peril.    And, okay, so my theory is a joke too (probably), but it does at least explain why, on his deathbed, Marco Polo himself is said to have remarked that he’d, “told only half of the things I’ve seen.” I bet.",2022-11-28 18:52:34,3,en,2022-11-28 18:52:34,11,2022,0.00094,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,508

Tanya,"I loved Calvino’s postmodern classic 
  If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler
, but even that novel’s bizarre structure couldn’t prepare me for the experience of this earlier work, which I found more ephemeral, and much harder to review. By framing the ‘story’ as conversations between Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo, Calvino explores both imagination and the imaginable through descriptions of fifty-five fictitious cities bearing female names, in what’s essentially a deconstruction of Polo’s original travelogue from the 13th century. 
  “With cities, it is as with dreams: Everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”
The city descriptions are short, rarely longer than a single page, and can be best described as prose poems; they meditate on different aspects of human nature, culture, and experience, with the occasional interludes between the emperor and merchant discussing these topics in less oblique ways. Just like in If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler, the reader is playing a game with the author, trying to find hidden patterns in this uniquely constructed book. There are nine parts, but each chapter within them belongs to one of eleven themes, and the adherence to these actually follows a strict mathematical pattern—but the structure can be played with by either reading it chronologically, or by following the grouped chapters instead. Much like a traveler can follow a myriad of itineraries to connect dots on a map, so the book seems to encourage the reader to also pick his own path between Calvino’s invisible cities; there are Cities and Memory, Cities and Desire, Cities and Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities and Eyes, Cities and Names, Cities and the Dead, Cities and the Sky, Continuous Cities, and Hidden Cities… it’s like a grown-up and poetic Choose Your Own Adventure type of short book, specially constructed to have a potential conclusion anywhere within it.This isn’t light reading, and I fear I may have “rushed” through it—I read it grouped by each part, but this is the type of work probably better served by savoring each subchapter as if they were stand-alone poems to be dissected. The language was spellbinding, and the vivid pictures of cities painted in turn exotic, fantastical, yet oddly archetypal in a way that put into words just what it is that I love about traveling to foreign places—how the tourist urge of escaping the confines of where we live for somewhere else is really a search of something within ourselves, as well as a need to expand our horizon by collecting and “conquering” new places, in a way similar to Khan expanding his empire, vicariously experiencing it through Polo’s narrations. 
  “Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: The foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.”
Invisible Cities also made me stop and think about how many of the places I’ve visited (Kyiv; Dresden; Hiroshima), and the ones I likely never will (Baghdad; Kabul; Aleppo), can already be considered, or will in time become, a titular invisible city—ghosts of what they once were, or gone forever, preserved only in memories and faded photographs. This is a book that can’t be classified or explained, but must be experienced and felt, much like the act of traveling itself.(Notes: Read in the original Italian)",2022-05-16 01:20:18,4,en,2022-05-16 01:20:18,5,2022,0.00107,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,616
Michael,"Not to sound crass or anything, but this is perfect for the bathroom. A series of one-to-two page portraits, each one focused on a new fantastical city. Like Escher drawings, each city is impossible, yet reflects our real-world perception of cities we've been to. It's more a meditation on the city as a concept than on any of the cities actually discussed. Also, in some ways it feels more like the experience of reading a book of poetry than a novel. Although a theme holds this all together, every chapter can be taken in isolation. Thus, one loses nothing if they read this gradually, one chapter at a time. Like if they read it while pooping, for instance. The story, if you want to call it that, is about Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. At the twilight of Khan's empire, Polo arrives and tells him stories of the cities he has been to. The evolution of their relationship, and the evolution of how they communicate, is interspersed with chapters on surreal cities. This structure doesn't really create a linear tale. Fortunately, the book doesn't need one to be fascinating. Example chapter:When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is a wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.Many of the chapters end with a sudden revelation that throws the entire city into a new light. Unfortunately, a lot of these revelations don't quite make sense, and one gets the feeling something was lost in the translation from Italian to English. Roughly half the stories had fascinating conclusions; most of the others had endings that felt like something was lost in translation; and a handful just felt like weak entries. Because so many chapters end with supercool revelations, the cities that turn out to be nothing more than fanciful and interesting to think about seem like let-downs. It's like if you think someone is setting up an elaborate joke, and the punch line is about to hit you in the gut, and then they say, ""Cool, huh?"" and you realize they're done and it was just a story, no punchline or conclusion. But despite the unevenness, I really enjoyed this, and plan on tracking down more of Calvino's books this summer. I'm especially hoping to find If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, which I started reading in a book store months ago and had to tear myself away from. Calvino is experimental in a fun and non-snobby way, which is my favorite kind of experimental. This could be the beginning of a brilliant relationship.And I promise the whole relationship won't revolve around bathroom trysts, Calvino.

Asim Bakhshi,"One can't get enough of it and though I keep coming back to it time and again, this time I revisited it in Urdu translation. Given the inherent poetics of Urdu, all the cities imagined by William Weaver's translation seems beautifully refurbished. Zeenat Hisam has done another masterful translation of a modern classic. She has captured the imaginative essence of the novel by achieving the same dream-like quality of William Weaver's English translation. I read some passages more than once to test whether I feel suspended between the poetry and prose in Urdu, which is signature Calvino. It happened without fail. I would certainly do a detailed review, however, any future reader or translator must know that geometrical structure of the novel is very important here, which is imported through a literary device of preserving homogeneity of titular relational attributes of each respective subset of the 55 cities. I love that now we have an amazing Urdu translation to try to solve this Rubik Cube of novel in the language we love.",2021-09-09 15:47:55,5,en,2021-09-09 15:47:55,9,2021,0.00058,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,172
J.M. Hushour,"Though much less cohesive as far as narrative and actual progression of any kind of story, this is one of Calvino's more poetic works. Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan about the cities of his empire he'll never be able to know. But does Polo actually know, asks the Khan? What are the cities Polo is telling him about? There is much beauty in the descriptions of the various cities and they are grouped sporadically into different types, named for various women. Calvino manages to imbue each of the 50 or so locations with a vivacity of description and surreality in 1-2 pages only, a testament to his genius for prose. As always, there's a great deal of subtext here: language, memory, travel, myth, and so on. Probably for the Calvino completist, I couldn't recommend it to the general reader who would probably find the novel's uncertainty and abstruse structure difficult.",2013-05-10 18:37:41,4,en,2013-05-10 18:37:41,5,2013,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,150

Ilana,"★★ ½ Far too clever for me. I failed to see the point or understand much of what was going on. Read the French translation which I doubt is the reason for my incomprehension; this is a poetic vision of cities presented as a dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. I don’t speak or read Italian but I may as well have read it in the original version as it would probably have made as much sense to me. Some nice turns of phrases and at times I felt transported for short bursts here and there when my brain wasn’t resisting and saying “this is all very nice but what the hell is going on here?!”I suppose I could give it five stars and say this book was a surreal and transporting experience to make myself look like a real intellectual, but I’m not trying to impress anyone.

Ken,"This difficult-to-categorize book is prose, yes, but shares with poetry a certain inscrutableness that demands stopping, shifting into reverse, and rereading what you just read. That's Italo Calvino for you, especially when he's in cryptic mode, especially when he's writing about city after city after city, only to be writing about a city (singular), which just might be Marco Polo's Venice (when the narrative refrain of Marco talking to Kublai Khan occurs) or just might be any city you care to imagine -- the City of Earth, maybe.You can find plenty of vocabulary words that will send you diving for the dictionary (or driving over the dead, if that's your method of dealing with the unknown). For instance, in one brief stretch, I hit bollard (=a post of metal or wood on a wharf around which to fasten mooring lines), demijohns (= a narrow-necked bottle or stoneware enclosed in wickerwork and holding from one to 10 gallons), cambered (= curved upward in the middle), corbels (= architectural members that project from within a wall support a weight), and porphyry (= a rock consisting of feldspar crystals embedded in a compact dark red or purple groundmass). Mostly it's names for ""stuff"" that we don't bother ascribing names to, but we sure as hell respect those who DO.You will also find lots of quotable quotes. There's this: ""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask."" No, I'm not there yet, but I'm trending that way. ""Say... she looks familiar...,"" and all that.My favorite parts are the italicized conversations between Polo and Khan, not the descriptions of ""cities,"" only because the two are talking on completely different planes and it often takes a koan-like turn that's of much greater value than any more definitive conversation between conqueror and explorer slash trader.And the parting lines! In a book like this, I wouldn't call the final lines ""spoilers,"" but if you disagree, STOP reading right here and go do something more profitable like eat a gallon of Ben &amp; Jerry's Cherry Garcia or something:""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constance vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""Words to live by -- in cities visible AND invisible.",2015-04-24 18:27:22,4,en,2015-04-24 18:27:22,4,2015,0.00152,0.0001,0.00022,0.00011,0.00021,0.00016,486
Richelle Wilson,"My first instinct was to give it four stars because five just seems like such a commitment. But then I had to ask: Who am I kidding? I loved this book. I have been wading through a lot of postmodern fiction, all with such meandering prose and weighty theoretical implications, all of which have been enjoyable and instructive on some level. Calvino's Invisible Cities was a book that I finished almost before realizing that I had started, which is rare for me. Each of the cities Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan is a gem unto itself, both for its stunning images and its relationship to larger questions about the human existence. A lot of the postmodern play has to do with how many of the cities have mirrored counterparts and other binary divisions, or perhaps how a city has multiple versions of itself that rise and fall and give rise to something new. In this way, what we typically think of as a ""city,"" consistent over time and occupying the same space, is not actually the same place, nor does it deserve the same name. On the other hand, Marco Polo comes to find (or is imagined to come to find) that all cities are the same. Maybe they are all Venice.Oh, and that's the other thing. We're not sure if this conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo is actually happening or whether it's a memory or an imagined conversation, brought into existence by their own thoughts or the thoughts of a beggar on the street. They are playing chess as they chat, which has no small bearing on the meaning of the text, either: count the number of cities (without the italics sections) and the number of overarching ""chapters"" in the text: 55 + 9 = 64. There are sixty-four squares on a chessboard. What might this mean? Perhaps that our relationships to cities and to one another, just like those in chess, are highly structured but ultimately arbitrary. Their meaning is in the imposed structure. (But what happens when we lose that? Do we accept the inferno or find the beauty that exists in the midst of it?)Ah, forgive me for rambling on about things like that. Just read this book because it's beautiful and fascinating.A favorite excerpt (of which there are many):""What is the aim of a city under construction unless it is a city? Where is the plan you are following, the blueprint?""""We will show it to you as soon as the working day is over; we cannot interrupt our work now,"" they answer.Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars.

krishnendu mukherjee,"Invisible cities - at it's heart - is an experiment to take fiction beyond its current form and more importantly, beyond the general expectations of a reader, even a seasoned one. The book, at least on the surface, is about a conversation between two historical mammoths; one is an inveterate Italian traveler: Marco Polo and other, a conqueror or as the novel says, The emperor of Tartars, the great Kublai Khan. Marco describes to Kublai the cities he has visited in his lifetime, and also very transparently, Kublai suspects everything he says. He tries in every way to remember and find, where could possibly 'this' city and 'that' one would be. Marco plays on his ignorance, as the great Khan is apparently not informed about his own kingdom and its subjects. Marco, of course, is recreating these cities from his memories, imagination, cities that existed at that period, cities he wished to exist, and some obvious inspiration from his hometown, Venice. He mainly clusters each city into one of these: continuous cities, cities and desire, hidden cities, cities and memory, cities and signs, cities and names, trading cities, cities and eyes, cities and the sky, cities and the dead, and thin cities. Each city's form is dependent on one of these fundamental features. Like cities and the dead usually deals with how uniquely the inhabitants of 'this' city deals with dead people or even unborn ones. Cities and the sky describe a city's relation to the sky. In one of my favorite of this kind, is a city hanging between two mountains and the ropes are just about to break and the people are still living there, waiting for their fate. Similarly, continuous cities are the one which is changing its form every second. Trading cities are cities created for business but they often don't trade in money, it could be anything from memory to name to even lives.This book is amazing and refreshing, among the times of automated scripted shows in Netflix to Amazon prime, to the cliche Marvel flicks every summer, and even in between the fiction that is released every year. I also am confounded how someone in the '70s wrote something like this. I would recommend this very strongly. You won't be disappointed.

Greg,"The contents of ""Invisible Cities"" is all in the title: this novel is about the capabilities of man's unlimited imagination. While reading this book, I kept thinking, ""Have I read this before, it feels familiar?"" Then I realized why: I've read Gary Jennings' ""The Journeyer"" which is a massive (1000+ page) historical fiction study of Marco Polo's life and travels, during which he meets Kublai Khan. Naturally, there is nothing new under the sun, but I had to check the publication dates: ""Invisible Cities"" pre-dates the publication of ""The Journeyer"" by a decade or so. Italo Calvino could have selected any two traveling characters to discuss where they have been and what they have seen, but the meeting of Polo and Khan is certainly one of great historical significance. (I can't recall if history has proven this meeting actually did take place, nor do historians know if Polo continued his travels from Venice all the way to North America, predating Columbus' visit by several hundred years, but there are ancient maps indicated Polo did at least make it to Alaska and portions of the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California.) And although this book veers toward Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" territory, in which that poet seems to list every geographical feature he has ever came upon, Calvino dazzles in his fantastical descriptions of architecture colliding with and adjusting to geographical features, all while incorporating the central idea that no matter what, these ""invisible cities"" must be able to accommodate human bodies/needs. An enjoyable feat of imagination, certainly. There is a small plot, a mystery: where are these cities? But basically, this is more of a free-form book of poetry than a novel.",2017-07-02 22:27:37,3,en,2017-07-02 22:27:37,7,2017,0.0006,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,282
René,"Kublai Khan, having ravished lands and treasures in an immense empire, having submitted men and cities over incommensurable distances, sometimes gets a little sad in the evenings when he's not exactly sure what he's acquired, not totally convinced all the bloodshed was worth it, not persuaded he can keep the empire, and mostly confused about what his empire really holds.What is the purest value of what his empire has to offer?Marco Polo knows! A spice merchant by trade, dreamer by nature, he's been everywhere and has had a lot of time to reflect on such matters. Polo sits in the evenings with our melancholy emperor and shows him the fine structure of those most wondrous cities that populate the empire.Excepting a few passages where the Khan and Polo dialog back and forth, and Polo acting so smart one is sure the Khan will strangle him eventually, most of the chapters are descriptions of cities.But what cities are these? Roaming through those chapters are like roaming through a dream, where one suspects that on some level all of this makes sense, only not in any way about a city. Describing a city, its inhabitants, its past and destiny, its fears and hopes, Polo is describing something else, that sometimes resembles the paradoxes and contradictions of the human psyche, sometimes the barriers and tunnels of language itself, sometimes the poetry of cohabitation, sometimes the dualities and ambivalence of ambition. The cities are sometimes blueprints, sometimes metaphors, sometimes memories. Having read Invisible Cities, one is unsure of what one has read, uncertain what one will remember of it, wondering how to describe it.",2012-10-30 16:44:20,5,en,2012-10-30 16:44:20,10,2012,0.00098,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,270
Christine,"May 2019 Bookclub read	Once upon a time, there was a guy called Macro Polo, and he invented a very cool pool game.	Yeah, I know. But he did talk to Kublai Khan about cities.	Or was it one city? Or women?	Calvino’s book isn’t so much a story but a mediation. The question is what he is mediating on. Is it simply how a city can be so many things? Any city can be. Each neighborhood of a city is like a minor city. The rhythm of city differs not only from events – Philly celebrating the Super Bowl win is different than the Mummers which is different than Taps in the Park.	Of course, you could say that people are cities too. All our cells, organs, and what not. Our veins and arteries are the freeways. 	Then, are the cities also women? Does Polo see the city as a city of women because he had a wife and three daughters? Or because there was a woman in every district for him?	Every city in this book is contains a woman’s name, and the names can be seen as symbolic, whether or not they are supposing to be symbols, well its’ Calvino. So, anything goes.	The small descriptive pieces transcend space and time. There are doubled cities. Cities above and below. It is impossible not to think of the City and the City when reading this. Mielville’s later novel deals with class and crime, something that haunts Calvino’s work but is not dealt with in the same way.	The strange thing is that thinking of Calvino’s work which also seems to refer to the death of cities, and that is prophetic considering the effect of climate change on some cities, including Polo and Calvino’s Venice.",2018-04-22 21:39:17,4,en,2018-04-22 21:39:17,4,2018,0.00094,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00016,288
Hollis,"I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this. The best way I can explain is that it is basically the literary equivalent of one of those MC Escher engravings. What amazed me about the book is that it is less than 150 pages in length. If any writer in the world today attempted a book as profound as this it would have to be 500 pages at least (with a further two volumes to make up a trilogy, if the writer is in the fantasy genre). Not that anyone could make something as profound as this.Reading this book made me realise just how good fiction can be and just how inadequate most of it really is. I think most of us who are raised in America and Britain and not really taught languages properly think that 'English literature' is the be-all and end-all and that the English-language writers are the best. Of course, it's true that we have many good and excellent writers but our best can't compete with the best of Italy or Latin America. Martin Amis and Ian McEwan are two of our most celebrated writers: put them next to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and they start to look ever so slightly frayed, don't you think? Even the richest fantasies of Gaiman, LeGuin and Gavriel Kay look pallid next to those of Calvino.This is an exceptional book that really demonstrates what fiction should be and only rarely is.

Ashish,"3.5 stars. My second book by Calvino after the splendid ""If on a Winter's Night a Traveller""The one thing that stands out in the book is the beautiful,poetic language used. The sentences look immaculately constructed and structured to draw you into the ideas expressed, almost to the point that it's poetry without verse. The book is divided into numerous chapters each of them being a page or two in length and each features the exploits of the traveller (Marco Polo) in them as he visits various cities. Peppered among these chapters is the conversation between Polo and Khan as the former tries to paint a picture of Khan's Empire via the description of cities.The book gets a bit too abstract for my taste (like the middle third of ""if on a winter's night a traveller), but deserves a read just for the sheer brilliance of the language used, and for the allegories and themes of cities and what they represent about the people who make and live in them.",2016-11-29 20:47:14,3,en,2016-11-29 20:47:14,11,2016,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,169
Duncan,"A kind of condensed, postmodern Scheherazade. A series of beautifully written glimpses at mythical and often anachronistic cities eventually takes form as a thread of a human story that frames each section. Kublai Khan shares his existential fears and Marco Polo assuages them in the abstract, describing diverse and impossible versions of what might well be the same city- or no city.This is a quick read and by no means does it demand interpretation. The prose is poetic enough that it would be possible, even preferable, to float through a few cities from time to time before returning to Polo's 'narrative'. This is a great book, but maybe not a profoundly affecting one.

It comprises a series of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, on the nature of cities, their like, and how they affect their inhabitants and visitors.

Invisible Cities captures imagery, feeling and wonderful prose, mixing architecture, emotion and wanderlust and capturing the feelings with ease. Calvino has written a wonderful book that kept me reading to the end, and at times the book was profound and breathtaking. This is a fabulous read, and one that I feel requires multiple looks.

Mina,"Each story is a metaphor of an aspect of life; cities are what we generally do, more than a house, a representation of humanity as social entities and of those who are not social.A bit too hand-wavy, lacking a coherent foundation to give the stories an underlying common thought.A couple of thoughtsWords and expressionFramed inside a series of dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, the cities, as Marco will often observe, are hard to express in words. The more Marco learns the Tartar language, the more Kublai Khan is saddened by the loss of expressivity of the movements and props that the merchant had previously used to communicate.Marco always speaks of VeniceWhen Kublai presses Marco on his hometown, Marco says that in every city he mentions, there is a bit of Venice. He is concerned that in putting his city into words he is losing it, bit by bit.This is an especially valid point for people who live in other countries.There is a concept, that in ‘coding’ our experiences into words, we are in fact reducing them. Especially as Marco hadn’t been home in a long time, the more you repeat your ‘story’ of what home is like, the more you may come to believe in a reduced, distorted essence - not in the real thing. It becomes, a series of justifications, rather than a rich recollection.",2019-07-16 02:04:08,4,en,2019-07-16 02:04:08,7,2019,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,228
Jason,"If you are expecting a high-brow clever analysis of this classic book, then in true Marco Polo liar-liar-pants-on-fire style....read on. Reading this is like being trapped inside a painting by Dalí, a discussion between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo transports the reader to bizarre city after bizarre city. Every word used feels like it is there to trip you up and maybe distract you from the fact Marco Polo has never travelled anywhere in his life...the evidence is there Marco Polo was born in 1254 and YET he lands at a city in a plane, hmmm that's me suspicious. Also all these cities seem to be named after women, maybe he was looking at the wrong little black book and this was his other list of conquests.My favourite part of this book was just how many bizarre cities Calvino was able to create, there was one where the air was replaced with earth and if you put your ear to the ground you might be able to hear a door slamming, there was another that felt like purgatory, no matter how long you walked you never made it to the actual city and were stuck in the outskirts and another where each morning everything was brand new and yesterdays stuff was thrown on the curb to go to the landfill.It's not all absurd fiction, each city ends with an existential question about things like ""what exists outside the city walls?"" and ""where do all these pianos go that we dump on the curb?"" It's all very clever and had me chuckling a few times, the one bit I didn't really understand was the chapter titles, maybe one day during a re-read when I'm proper old and wise I'll understand...until then this was fun.Blog review: https://felcherman.wordpress.com/2023...",2023-01-18 02:20:57,4,en,2023-01-18 02:20:57,1,2023,0.0055,0.00011,0.00042,0.00014,0.00041,0.00025,295
Paul,"This isn't a novel in the traditional sense but a series of descriptions of fantastical cities that Marco Polo is telling to Kublai Khan at the height of his empire. It's a lot to make sense of and keep straight in your head. I read a couple of cities per day which did give me time to think about each section but also made it more difficult to remember how a new city might relate to an earlier one. How the vignettes connect and expand on each other really defies the reader to stay with one interpretation and one conclusion. Calvino will lead you down to a corner of your brain you didn't know you had, vanish, and then force you to retrace your steps back into another corner. That might sound overly metaphorical but it's really the only way I have to describe the experience.

Alisdair,"Exquisite. Calvino’s cities take form like jewels in a half remembered dream, reflecting some beautiful and otherworldly light. This book touches on memory, desire, the ways that cities exist in the concrete and the abstract at the same time. Some highlights: “Each man bears in his mind a city made only of differences, a city without figures and without form”“Cities, like dreams, are made of desired and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals everything else”“Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased”, Polo said. “Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, by speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little”",2023-01-08 02:22:01,5,en,2023-01-08 02:22:01,1,2023,0.00077,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,129
Josh,"What a strange book.Invisible Cities is exactly the kind of book I always wondered, and hoped, existed. Cities are such a fascinating topic, one that I never felt was explored properly by other literature. The format and framing of the book is unique to say the least. It's original, experimental, yet also extremely simplistic. Although I couldn't see him writing anything quite like this, I was reminded of the initial I-didn't-know-you-could-do-this shock response I had when first reading Borges.Being such an original format, it's hard to tell if Invisible Cities is good or not– there's simply nothing to compare it to. Without a doubt, I was shocked at it's originality, but after that shock dies down, I was confused on what to think. Is it poetic, beautiful? Is it pretentious and nonsensical? Did this take a lot of skill and craft to think of, or is it simply some weird cities? Is it even a problem if it's just a book of weird cities?I'll attempt to answer these. The book is often poetic and beautiful, but definitely teeters into pretentious territory. Your mileage will vary, of course, but even the most open-minded reader is bound to find a few parts to scoff at. I never had any problems with the city sections (except for maybe Tamara, in Cities &amp; Signs 1), but all of the italicized sections about Marco Polo and Kublai Khan's interactions were grueling. Polo and Khan came off as bumbling dopes, rambling about juvenile what-if's such as ""what if we're the only things that are real,"" ""what if we're not real,"" ""what if nothing is real,"" and ""what if only this azalea bush is real."" While they puff away at pipes (the substance isn't said, but it doesn't take much to guess), they wonder if they're actually talking to each other, or if they're just imagining the other talking. While Borges' philosophies and metaphysics can be dense, Calvino's philosophies can be uninteresting (in a beaten-to-death-by-teen-stoners way), but it's his unrestrained imagination elsewhere that draws you in.Invisible Cities is more than a collection of weird, fantastic cities. Every city has a message or a philosophical point to drive home. Some cities talk about, simply, the nature and movement of cities and their people. Others discuss how the mind interprets and views the world. Some have clear social commentaries, such as the false conservatism of the Maurilians (in Cities &amp; Memory 5), and the environmental message of the wasteful Leonians (in Continuous Cities 1), who create an impenetrable shield of landfill mountains around their city. A few cities don't contain any discernable message, but they are often delightfully surreal enough to not be an issue (such as Armilla, the city of water pipes, and Procopia, the city full of hundreds of polite faces all eating corn).On multiple times throughout the novel I would come across a few sentences that made me happy to know that other human beings had feelings and realizations I thought were very personal or abnormal... or at least feelings and realizations I never thought of talking about to anyone before.I have a feeling I could change the star rating drastically over the next few months– the book is just that strange, it'll take some time to let it all sink in. Regardless, Invisible Cities is an incredibly original experience that is short and easy enough that no one has an excuse not to give a try.Calvino also says the 14th century had cities that contained skyscrapers, roller-coasters, motorcyclists, refrigerators, radios, and streets lined with tram tickets. And Marco Polo traveled by flying from airport to airport. That's like, so po-mo.",2012-01-30 06:57:46,4,en,2012-01-30 06:57:46,1,2012,0.00614,0.00011,0.00049,0.00014,0.00042,0.00023,604
Osama Siddique,"Through an imaginary dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo the incredibly distinctive Italian stylist Italo Calvino brings to us a literary tour de force that offers as many tiers of meanings and layers of insights as the vast number of real and imaginary cities it explores. Using an ingenious narrative approach and structure Calvino explores how cities can mean so many different things to different people at different times; and, also how they epitomize human existence, habitation, aspirations, anxieties and endeavor in their most complex manifestations. In his narration of cities visited and imagined - 55 in all - what is resonant also is Polo's constant yearning for his native Venice. Is he really describing Venice in all its facets and avatars even when he purports to be describing so many novel and seemingly different cities. On the other hand, in Qublai Khan's hearing and assessment of these narratives there is also concurrent introspection and a brutal assessment of what conquest, empire, power, and legacy mean. Exquisitely imagined and equally exquisitely written, this is a book for writers, architects, artists, rulers, designers, poets, historians and dreamers. And for any city dwellers who wants to embark on an exercise of imagining and wonder.Invisible Cities definitely doesn't lend itself to any easy categorization. Memoir, travel, architecture, fantasy, speculative fiction, history, urban planning, philosophy - it is a heady mix of all this and more. Quirky and incredibly vast in its conceptualization and structure, it lists cities according to multiple themes such as memory, desire, signs, thinness, trading, eyes, names, the dead, sky, hidden, and continuous. But this doesn't even begin to encompass the tremendous variety and diversity of insights, angles and perspectives with which Calvino explores human relationships with and perceptions of cities and also what the latter denote and represent by way of the human civilizational experience. As he says: ""Only in Marco Polo's accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites' gnawing.""Ultimately impactful, thought provoking as well as unsettling, aesthetic and deeply sensitive, Invisible Cities stands in its unique and independent shelf, as a specimen of creative imagining at its richest.",2022-12-08 23:48:16,5,en,2022-12-08 23:48:16,12,2022,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,371
Oleksandr Zholud,"This is a weird fiction from the New Wave of the early 1970s, when writing down ones' psychedelic trips was popular among more progressive authors. This is a rare case, when a translated novel was nominated for a major SFF award, namely for Nebula in 1976. It lost to The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. Also, unlike in most years, when 5-6 nominees are announced, that time is was 18 (!), so it isn’t that surprising that a translation was able to get to the list. I read it as a part of the monthly reading for December 2022 at Hugo &amp; Nebula Awards: Best Novels group.This is a rather short novel, which starts with describing several fantastic cities, listed in several groups, e.g Cities &amp; Memory or Thin Cities. the description are brief, usually less than a page and ‘in your face’ unrealistic, like the city of Tamara. You penetrate it along streets thick with signboards jutting from the walls. The eye does not see things but images of things that mean other things: pincers point out the tooth-drawer’s house; a tankard, the tavern; halberds, the barracks; scales, the grocer’s. Statues and shields depict lions, dolphins, towers, stars: a sign that something—who knows what?—has as its sign a lion or a dolphin or a tower or a star. As it turns out, all these cities are described by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan as they lie in his gardens smoking opium and discussing the nature of a city and of the imagination, going from that every city is just a Venice in disguise (Polo’s home town) to that only unreality of these cities allows for their existence. There is no plot, no action, just a city after city, some – a clear satire of the present-day issues like  ‘the city of Leonia refashions itself every day: every morning the people wake between fresh sheets, wash with just-unwrapped cakes of soap, wear brand-new clothing, take from the latest model refrigerator still unopened tins, listening to the last-minute jingles from the most up-to-date radio. On the sidewalks, encased in spotless plastic bags, the remains of yesterday’s Leonia await the garbage truck.’  or purely imaginary like twin cities, where each action is mirrored in some way is a ‘twin’.The book is full of snippets, some interesting, a lot – less so, an experiment that I guess works better in an even shorter form.",2022-12-11 01:19:52,2,en,2022-12-11 01:19:52,12,2022,0.00132,0.0001,0.0002,0.0001,0.0002,0.00016,403
J.J.,"What a unique and enchanting little book this is. I don't know if it can be called a novel, it's not really a work of narrative art in any traditional sense and is more like a series of dialogues between two interpretations of historical figures, Marco Polo as a messenger to Kublai Khan in a series of travelogues which end up being the basis for spiritual and existential parables, most of them ultimately focusing on the concept of subjectivity of perception and how cities contain every breadth of the human experience. What results is a literary city symphony, as much attuned to the textural components of manmade civilizations as it is to the human heart that beats underlying all of them. Polo's parables increasingly take on a fantastical register [and even one that seems to jump into the far future at points], but the conviction, strength of description and lucidity of his described travels to the Khan as well as the book's focus on the inherent malleability of interpretation for even concretely existing phenomena, in this case cities, ends up making his accounts astoundingly convincing. And the structural formalism here is extremely simple yet enormously effective - each ""type"" of city Marco describes is given in the chapter headers, and the direct dialogues between he and the Khan are italicized and the two here have intimate conversations about what is being discussed, giving them established characters, and there are pages of empty space in between chapters giving the book a feel of expanding as vastly as the cities described, making it feel as appropriately all-enveloping as it should be despite the short page count. If you are a person who has much nostalgia and appreciation for any city [or even just community], as I do with New York, you will find something powerful and resonant to latch onto here, whether in the Marco-Khan chapters or the actual parables. I expected Calvino to impress me, but not expecting this to be as unique and evocative as it is. Love the cover too, my beloved postmodern minimalism [which can apply to the structure of the book in general].""Kublai Khan had noticed that Marco Polo's cities resembled one another, as if the passage from one to another involved not a journey but a change of elements. Now, from each city Marco described to him, the Great Khan's mind set out on its own, and after dismantling the city piece by piece, he reconstructed it in other ways, substituting components, shifting them, inverting them.""",2022-06-28 21:56:17,4,en,2022-06-28 21:56:17,6,2022,0.00106,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,420
El Bibliófilo,"My comments in video: https://youtu.be/9nrhPxjhlwkLike Borges, he unites philosophy and literature in the city as the maximum representation of the human.Based on the plausibility of Marco Polo's story, who describes the cities to the emperor Kublai Khan, Italo Calvino makes a series of profound descriptions of cities, which invite philosophical reflection, such as the human environment itself. With short and messy chapters, which can perhaps be read in different ways like Cortázar's ""Hopscotch"", it presents us with cities that range from the improbable to the real and current of the metropolises, with criticism of religion, capitalism, pollution but always inviting us and inciting us to think about The City (the description of the city that contains all others, similar to Borges with the book that contains all the books) and the cities, from different perspectives. A deep and entertaining work. I believe that it is more and better enjoyed if you have previously read Marco Polo's travels.I await your commentsComo Borges, une filosofía y literatura en la ciudad como máxima representación de lo humano.Sustentando la verosimilitud en la historia de Marco Polo, que describe las ciudades al emperador Kublai Kan, Italo Calvino realiza una serie de descripciones profundas de ciudades, que invitan a la reflexión filosófica, como el entorno propiamente humano. Con capítulos cortos y desordenados, que acaso se puedan leer de diferentes maneras como ""Rayuela"" de Cortázar, nos presenta ciudades que van desde lo improbable hasta lo real y actual de las metrópolis, con críticas a la religión, al capitalismo, a la contaminación pero siempre invitándonos e incitándonos a pensar en La Ciudad (la descripción de la ciudad que contiene todas las otras, que similar a Borges con el libro que contiene todos los libros) y las ciudades, desde distintas perspectivas.

vivliovision,"The City is a human creation, but the Citizen is the creation of the City.But, what is a City?Is it a womb, a structure, a name, an architectural conception (or misconception), a composite of impressions, an organism, a maze, a common ground, a melting pot, a market, a palimpsest, 'a constantly changing pastiche of associations and experiences', a context, a sum or a cluster of neighborhoods, a hive, a flee, a pattern, a function, a network, a modus vivendi, a settlement, a symbol, a frame of reference, a need, a form, an idea, a foreign or a mother tongue, an identity, a subjective perception of a collective meaning; or, simply, the material expression of our archetypal desire for coexistence? Italo Calvino has no objective answers to offer. However, he has various subjective examples to suggest. Walking the roads of Invisible Cities is like reading between the lines --everything is there, in common view, hidden. Looking beyond the familiar lines of perception, Calvino had a fleeting glimpse into infinity: cities within cities within cities . . . ...At this point Kublai Khan interrupted him or imagined interrupting him, or Marco Polo imagined himself interrupted, with a question such as: 'You advance always with your head turned back?' or 'Is what you see always behind you?' or rather,'Does your journey take place only in the past?'...By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present....For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return.

Jim,"These are all cities that never were, or that were everywhere, cities that once existed, cities that can perhaps exist in future -- much like the places in the giant atlas that Kublai Khan shows his visitor, Marco Polo. Ostensibly, Marco describes the cities one by one to he Great Khan, who does not recognize them, leaving him with feelings of longing and foreboding.Invisible Cities is perhaps the best book I have read by Italo Calvino, such that I want to read it again and again, and identify which cities I wish to visit, or to avoid. Take Marozia for example:It also happens that, if you move along Marozia's compact walls, when you least expect it, you see a crack open and a different city appear. Then, an instant later, it has already vanished. Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order or rhythm; or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly. But everything must happen as if by chance, without attaching too much importance to it, without insisting that you are performing a decisive operation, remembering clearly that at any moment the old Marozia will return and solder its ceiling of stone, cobwebs, and mold over all heads.As I reread this passage, I see what to me is the art of travel. If you try to bludgeon every moment, the spiderwebs descend. Let it happen spontaneously, and new vistas open.This is a truly great little book that should be read by anyone for whom the life of the imagination is a guiding principle.",2015-06-13 12:23:30,5,en,2015-06-13 12:23:30,6,2015,0.00121,0.00011,0.00019,0.00013,0.0002,0.00017,307

In Berenice, the unjust city, there is a hidden ""city of the just,"" created by dissenters. Eventually, the inhabitants of the hidden city become so certain of their own rightness, ""and of being more just than many others who call themselves more just than the just,"" that the hidden city of the just gives rise to another unjust city.

Phil J,"A dumb person's review:I would probably like this book more if I was smarter. A smart person or a person with a lot of time on their hands would create a vast chart containing all the themes and motifs, all the relationships between the elements, and their development as connected to the Polo/Khan scenes. That smart person is not me.To me, this was a mosaic of vignettes. Each vignette described a city or a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. The Polo/Khan pieces are supposedly a framing device, but the city descriptions did not seem discernibly framed to my dull, overly literal sensibilities.Perhaps there is some Oulipo-style master algorithm determining the arrangement of all these pieces. Perhaps all the cities are in fact about Polo and Khan. To me, they were just isolated cities.The cities themselves, however, are really cool. Each is a metaphor for something or somethings, often the fallibility of communication, language, memory, order, disorder, history, the finite and the infinite, duality, etc. Each tiny chapter stirs thought, but I couldn't really figure out how all the chapters were connected. They could be 80 separate books as far as my slow, wool-witted mind is concerned.The only progression I noticed is that the Hidden Cities chapters in the last part and the final Polo/Khan segment seemed to be directly challenging the definition of the word ""city"" itself, which resolved some of the disorientation of the rest of the book and helped give it a ""wrapped up"" feel.In the end, I'm pretty sure this is one of those times that a lit professor could just give my whole review an atomic wedgie and run away laughing.

They are beautiful, as I'm starting to believe Calvino inevitably is, and layered, and thick with meaning. Each city is a pleasure to intellectually visit, and the through-narrative of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan lends goddamn everything to the story. The question of reality hangs heavy overhead: what can be real if everything is perception?And the fact that many of the cities bear female names is an allegorical goldmine.

Lee Foust,"I mentioned in a comment here on Goodreads a couple of years back, on a friend's review of Invisible Cities, that I had a theory about the text's form that I hoped some day to write about. Since I was then encouraged to spill the beans, so to speak, and since I'm just no longer writing scholarly papers but prefer to blather my literary opinions here on Goodreads for all to see, and since I've just read the book for the nth time in preparation for teaching it, let me then raise the gauntlet and see if I can't say something intelligible about the form of this interesting postmodern novel.I suppose the first order of business is to declare that, in my opinion, Invisible Cities is indeed a novel. The Mondadori edition that I possess has a quite interesting opening essay by the author himself who takes the opportunity for the reprint to expose and explain his writing process and some of his opinions regarding constructing such works of anti-fiction, if you will. (Calvino was apparently invited to do so by Mondadori for all of his major published works so I recommend these inexpensive paperback editions for these revealing introductory essays to those who can read Italian--they frequently enlighten us regarding the formal intricacies of Calvino's construction of narratives along systemic rather than narrative lines. But more on that anon.)At any rate, the author claims in the introduction, when describing how he came to construct Invisible Cities, that he feels that he was constructing a text ""even if not a novel in the strictest sense of the word,"" and that a text ""should have a plot, an itinerary, or, at the very least, a course to run."" Given this statement, and the arrangement of the 55 short descriptions of cities of the novel, divided into nine chapters (7 of five cites and two, the first and last chapters, of 10), each chapter introduced and closed by dialogues between medieval Venetian merchant traveler Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn, emperor of the Tartars, gives Invisible Cities, by the author's own standards, an itinerary or a course to run, even if it's not the classic character/conflict/rising action/crisis/resolution/falling action of a so-called traditional narrative. (I say so-called because I trust no system and can name more exceptions to the pattern than adherents, particularly in the oldest narratives with which I'm familiar--so tradition be damned.)In what, then, does the itinerary of Invisible Cities lie? Well, firstly, we note that the cities are not arranged by name or in the order in which Polo visited them or any such semi-realistic way, but are rather thematically ordered. The first two chapters, for instance are entitled ""Cities and Memory"" 1 and 2. Then follow ""Cities and Desire 1,"" ""Cities and Signs 1,"" and ""Subtle Cities 1,"" in a progressive sequence rounding out the first chapter. (Yes, I know that our English translator Weaver chose to render the Italian sottile as ""thin"" rather than ""subtle,"" and I do understand why, but, well, I prefer ""subtle."")Now I'm no mathematician so I'm not totally sure that ""progressive sequence"" is what I should be calling this thematic arrangement, but it makes sense to a literary scholar like myself. To wit, each theme (memory, desire, signs, and subtle) will appear in 5 separate descriptions in a progressive pattern that, in the opening chapter, goes like this: 1 - 1, 2 - 1, 2, 3 - 1, 2, 3, 4. In the shorter second chapter we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the third chapter, and the obvious by now 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in the next, and so on through eight chapters. The themes, therefore continue in the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 order with each theme dropping off after making five appearances and a new theme is introduced to fill its place. That is to say that the first theme (memory--which corresponds to the number 1 in the above schema) finishes as it opens the second chapter (when we've seen five of those types of cities) and is replaced by a new theme, ""Exchange"", at that chapter's close. The procession then reverses itself at the novel's close--chapter IX goes 8, 9, 10, 11 - 9, 10, 11 - 10, 11 - 11 completing the cycle of eleven city themes at five descriptions each equaling 55 descriptions of cities.So here's my interpretation of this system, to which Calvino makes almost no reference in his otherwise exhaustive introduction regarding how Invisible Cities came to be written and arranged: the first thing I note about the system is that the first and last chapters, in order to hold up the system, are both twice as long as the other seven chapters, having ten descriptions to the other chapters' five. This, to me, suggests symmetry and balance at either end of the book. Also, the stepping system of 1 - 1, 2 - 1, 2, 3 etc. suggested to me, well, steps, or some form of indentation. But, if the indentation reverses at the end, then that suggests an apogee with an equal number of rising and/or descending elements on either side. And, indeed, we have an unequal number here, 55 descriptions of cities, a number that can never be symmetrical in a squared or box pattern, but only if it has, say, a keystone at its center and the chapters stepped outward in both directions form an arch. Thus, the system, represents, I believe, an arch--or, better, the arch of a bridge.Why a bridge? Because the frame-narrative into which Invisible Cities places these descriptions of cities is, as has already been noted, a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn. A conversation also acts as a bridge, no? Particularly this conversation--and Polo's later recitation of his travels to the Frenchman who transcribed The Milione--are bridges between languages, just as his travels were bridges between the Eastern and Western worlds, and much fuss is made in their conversations about language, translation, gestures, and physical symbols or signs. Also much is made in the text about Venice, Marco Polo's hometown, a city of many bridges whose famous Rialto Bridge--as symbolic of Venice as the Leaning Tower is of Pisa--is a series of box-shaped shops stepping up to an apogee and descending down the other side. Thus I feel that the overall theme of this text about cities is travel, communication, and recitation (Marco Polo's acts) and that these themes are visually represented in the form of the novel as a bridge. In addition, although Calvino doesn't give away his numerical arrangement or its meaning--he even slips in the intro, proclaiming that the book has eleven chapters of five cities each, contradicting the actual form in which two chapters are combined into the first and last sections making nine chapters--he does make a point of argueng that the meaning of the novel is not, as so many critics wanted to proclaim, in the very last city described, but rather along what he calls, ""all of the novel's corners or edges."" Since the author himself says that he sees the novel as ""being in the form of a polyhedron,"" it defies the natural moral residing at a tale's end upon which so many so-called traditional narratives rely. Turn to the third city description of chapter V--the text's keystone or center--and you will find the description of the city of Bauci, which is built on stilts and whose inhabitants never descend to the ground either because a) they despise the Earth, b) they worship the Earth so much they don't want to soil it with their city or themselves, or c) they revel in observing the Earth through telescopes, charting their nostalgia for their own absence. Since the theme here is ""Cities and Eyes,"" I assume that the emphasis is on the city's gazing at and contemplation of the earth and their absence/presence upon/above it. That is indeed a perfect image of a keystone, no?Also, the conversation between Polo and Kahn at the end of chapter V deals, of course, with the two elements of the text symbolically: what makes an arch, the bricks or the arc shape? Both, for without bricks there is no arch, but without the mysterious form of the arc, like a reflection meeting in mid-air to uphold its two sides, the bricks would fall.Lastly I would also remark on the very many cities described in the novel that are mirrored either literally in water or figuratively by their necropolis, or a name, or one's approach (from land or sea) or in time, etc. Also, as Calvino himself emphasizes in the intro., the first and last cities represent happiness hidden inside sad cities. This theme of duality, life and death, word and thing, image and interpretation, past and future, is perfectly visually summed up by a bridge that is always mirrored, upside down and backward, in the water of the river that it spans.",2019-12-14 22:44:36,5,en,2019-12-14 22:44:36,12,2019,0.00059,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,1496
Ayush,"""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead out-number the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.""
Lost in a dreamy web of Invisible Cities, I found a stranger lightly drifting on a magical carpet from one mystical heaven to another.On his face, was a fading smile of melancholic curiosity, that almost clouded an unfamiliar sensation of the known unknown. A light blue magical wind, inviting, pulling him and mein an old new direction of its own inner ruminations,which promised abstract fantasies of warm gentle stimulationor was it just an imaginary simulation. In this fresh place, in that dying time, everything was burning, everything is alive. From the multicolored lamps illuminating the giant visible gates,to the infinitely convoluted staircases,paving way for a giant wave of memories. In this journey, no desire is lost, and no craving fulfilled,but in turn for an earthly form, it demands slavery and nostalgia.This treacherous city wants to possess you forever.But all is not lost, for we fall and walk among the dense neuronic trees,in a place that the Gods have forgotten.One can see distant buildings, the belching smoke and the ships,that will take us far away on a choppy waters reflecting a chaotic recurrence of the past,Again and again and again.Do these cities lie on a knifes edge or do they form a circle ?Perhaps when I have crossed a mountain pass, followed the fading signs, I can have a look at her innocent face.But cultures and customs change, like new smells, new breaths and new face,The past saw her rising beauty and shape,the present stutter through it unfazed,and with no guiding grace,the future ponders for the reasonwhy the place was even made.",2018-12-23 01:47:13,3,en,2018-12-23 01:47:13,12,2018,0.00215,0.0001,0.00021,0.00013,0.00023,0.00019,308

Martyn,"I know this book is primarily about the impossibility of ever knowing enough about anything, in this case the way that cities live and breath, especially for those in power over them (however far removed) but it also seems to say something about the whimsically lassez faire attitudes of our glorious leaders. In this case the Khan continues to demand stories about far off cities while, the text makes it clear, his own city and people are decaying. He will never know enough to save his own people since he only cares for daydreams and unreality. It seems a remarkably familiar trait in leaders down through the years, to rest on dreamy laurels, fiddling while cities burn, or indeed tweeting while people starve and bridges crumble; it makes me wonder if Calvino was also trying to say something about the banal evil of imperialism, in the sense that cities and cultures end up being the playthings of people who can't grasp a single salient fact about them, but that could just be my reading of it.",2019-05-27 13:41:30,4,en,2019-05-27 13:41:30,5,2019,0.00203,0.0001,0.00022,0.00012,0.00022,0.00019,176
Marc Kozak,"It's never a good idea to expect a novel in the traditional sense from Italo Calvino. Instead of your standard character development and plot structure, a Calvino novel is likely to follow a path similar to a Rube Goldberg device, and the result is typically brilliant. His 1972 classic Invisible Cities contains 55 one-to-three page descriptions of various cities visited by the famous world traveler Marco Polo. In between these descriptions are brief conversations between Polo and the emperor of these cities, the 13th century Mongul ruler Kublai Khan. Khan is getting older and wishes to hear of the greatness of his cities and the types of people who inhabit them, and Polo's stories provide fantastic and imaginative images of cities that may or may not exist.Calvino has always had a talent for fitting several balls of yarn into one normal-sized sweater. In one conversation between the two historical figures, he writes:Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. “But which is the stone that supports the bridge?” Kublai Khan asks.“The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,” Marco answers, “but by the line of the arch that they form.” Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: “Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is the arch that matters to me.” Polo answers: “Without stones there is no arch.”Even though it sounds like dialogue out of The Matrix movies, we can see how Polo is trying to frame Khan's view of his empire - as a series of stones, capably holding up his entire bridge of a kingdom.Many cities contain features that can be said about many cities today, whereas others couldn't possibly exist in our reality. The city of Armilla contains no walls, ceilings or floors, but a vast system of water pipes. Octavia is suspended in a precipice between two large mountains, hundreds of feet above the ground. Andria was built so that every street follows a planet's orbit. Other cities defy space and time, and seem to stretch out over the entire planet.One of the most interesting and still relevant aspects is the reoccurring theme of overcrowding and environmentalism. Leonia is a city where the inhabitants throw away anything that isn't new, eventually creating an enormous trash pile that is larger than the city itself. The pile of trash grows so large, Calvino imagines one city's garbage pile pressing up against neighboring city's piles, creating a world of waste. The city of Procopia possibly satirizes the overcrowding of the Far East, as every time Polo returned to it, the population had grown exponentially and eventually no one could even move at all.While many of Calvino's cities portray chaotic and negative features, his final message directly addresses how to avoid the calamity of our ""unjust world"":“The first [way:] is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”Invisible Cities has provided architects and designers with inspiration since it's publication thanks to Calvino's overflowing imagination. Art students in many universities are given this book, and told to design one of cities inside, a true testament to the far-reaching influence this book has had in the short time it's been around. An absolute classic from a must-read author.",2009-11-21 23:59:21,4,en,2009-11-21 23:59:21,11,2009,0.00124,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.0002,0.00017,579
Robin,"This book is barely prose. I read it the same way I would read poetry (which I do very little of, as poetry and I are infrequently simpatica), dipping into the brief descriptions of each surreal city and always feeling like I should re-read what I just read. I read this book concurrently with Alain de Botton’s The Art of Travel, almost as though that were my travel guide and this my journey. The combination served to render Invisible Cities even more dream-like than it already is. There is something deeply melancholic about this book. The conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan is preoccupied with the impossibility of the complete discovery or conquest, the instability inherent in daily life, the inevitability of decay. The cities that Marco Polo describes for the Khan reflect these preoccupations over and over again:“At this point Kublai Khan expects Marco to speak of Irene as it is seen from within. But Marco cannot do this: he has not succeeded in discovering the city that those of the plateau call Irene. For that matter, it is of slight importance: if you saw it, standing in its midst, it would be a different city; Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes.For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.”Invisible Cities is brief enough to be accessible for even those with limited patience for the intriguing but bewildering array of described settings and culminates in one of the most beautiful and perfect ending paragraphs that I have read in years. I will not spoil it by quoting it here--you have to get there yourself via the 164 pages that lead up to it, but it feels like taking a deep breath of fresh, cool air.",2012-03-20 11:01:31,5,en,2012-03-20 11:01:31,3,2012,0.00079,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,357
Sajid,"“With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.’ ”Fascinating stories on the boundless expansion of imaginative cities. A city that always exceeds its own limit. Signs,symbols,metaphors, metonym--what is not a city? As long as you imagine and as far as you can imagine, there will be cities in their utmost possibilities. They are not made of stones. But words. Words penetrate the very form of city. And we live in perpetual state of nostalgia where we always search for a city-- something that is lost,yet we search. An evergreen nostalgia like worm living in our heart.Calvino’s fiction isn’t a story; it’s an ordering and reordering of the emotional and philosophical reverberations of our civilized world, our human condition. The book itself is extremely formal—each chapter is a prose poem describing a city. Each city has variations. Cities are grouped into categories according to random patterns. Each city is imagined; each city is conceptual. Every interlude between Khan and Marco Polo is a thought experiment about powerful structures—empires, governments, languages, lands, tales. And the intelligence behind the entire construction is singular.This work of course was an experimental one. An experiment on human imagination perhaps. Just study the map of your mind through breath-taking description of Calvino's Invisible Cities.“You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.’ ”",2022-08-09 04:23:02,4,en,2022-08-09 04:23:02,8,2022,0.0038,0.0001,0.00026,0.00013,0.0003,0.00021,307
Antonis,"""The invisible cities"" is a unique book, it's a strange book and sometimes it's a hard one to understand but it always is an eye-opening and inspiring book above all. And I say always because you do not need to reach the end to understand this; just open a page at random and read about that city with an open mind and an open eye for the world around you. You will be wiser.The book contains descriptions of many many cities, maybe more than 50, all of them imaginative and fantastic. These are cities that don't exist anywhere, never existed and never will. But at the same time they are real and they are everywhere. I've read somewhere that the book's central point is the exploration of human imagination. Allow me to disagree! This book is about the human psyche, about sociology and social behaviour and evolution, about beliefs and traditions, about the details of everyday life and habits, about history and humanity, and about so much more that it would be overly optimistic to attempt to list here. Maybe it feels different to every reader but whatever it means to each, it surely is a work that is eye-opening, that enhances the perception and understanding of the world around us and of us humans in it.I should also like to mention that I read the book simultaneously in greek and english as I was lucky enough to have both editions at hand. I'm very pleased to say that the greek edition was not only at par with the english one, it was probably better as the translator rendered the language and the descriptions so naturally that I could have sworn that Italo Calvino had lived in Greece for most of his life!All in all, this is a higly recommended read for anyone, especially those with a restless and open mind.",2012-09-13 05:38:43,5,en,2012-09-13 05:38:43,9,2012,0.00076,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,311
J.I.,"This book is very, very difficult to summarize. Marco Polo describes cities he has been to to Kublai Khan. Okay, it's very easy to summarize. But here is the thing. Each of these cities is described in generally a page. Or less. They are not about cities, but they are about names and language, they are about memory and perceived memory, they are about desire and life and death and every possible conceivable subject. These subjects are not what this book is about. It is a truly interesting and striking masterpiece of postmodernism which gives Kublai Khan a problem. He sees that all is fragmentary and crumbled and he is attempting to grasp it all. He represents modernism. Marco Polo denies this ability to put things into such dialectical terms. He represents postmodernism. ""Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. 'But which is the stone that supports the bridge?' Kublai Khan asks. 'The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,' Marco answers, 'but by the line of the arch that they form.' Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: 'Why do you speak to me of stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.' Polo answers: 'Without stones there is no arch.'""But then the end gets interesting the binary between them (of modernism v postmodernism) is radically altered. This is a difficult book to read. It is short and it is strange and it is challenging in its plotlessness.

Ana-Maria Petre,"It was truly enlightening to read this in my summer travels, while journeying through many cities, old and new alike. I began associating sensations and images never-thought-before to the places I visited, finding magic in small details like the arcade of an old house or a tuft of green grass sprouting under a painted wall, a crack in the pavement or the odd walk of a little man.You will find references to modern-day New York, as well as New Atlantis, Utopia and Brave New World. The author's imagination is endless, and even though the cities start to resemble each other at times, it is never a complete similarity. There are also good bits of unconventional wisdom to be found, if you look closely.Having to entertain the Great Khan, the narrator speaks about old worlds, new worlds and imaginary worlds, weaving them together like an intricate oriental carpet of lives. The language is highly visual and beautifully descriptive, and Calvino manages to describe the people that inhabit those places by only implying them at times, through the effect they have on the visible and invisible face of things. Everything hides something, covers something or hints at something. There are underground cities, cities hung in the sky and deserted metropolises, all so familiar and far away at the same time.

His words are like the dreams that we sometimes have in mid-morning, the perfect ones, where everything is going exactly as planned, where a surprise, and a pleasant one is about to come to fore, where you've almost touched, felt, said what you've wanted to and then-snap! You wake up!Invisible Cities is like a dream with a dream ( Mr Edgar Allen Poe, the analogy is unintended and I am proud of it actually!). The story starts with Marco Polo in the court of Kublai Khan, narrating stories of cities he has visited. The best bit is, though, it isn't about the cities! It's about everyman being a city of sort himself, or every city, rather, being a man, a living, breathing, social organism that thinks, plan, manipulates, lies, deceives, loves and laughs. Through his descriptions, Calvino makes you think, ""Am I someone who is the product of places (s)he has lived in? Or are the places I have lived in a product of who I am?""I sound like Confucius to you? Well, read this book and you'll find out why? This one's a book to read and remember!",2012-08-15 00:48:54,5,en,2012-08-15 00:48:54,8,2012,0.01133,0.00011,0.00058,0.00019,0.00047,0.00028,204
Stacia,"Very poetic prose, like reading little gems &amp; polished stones from a beautiful kaleidoscope. Imo, this book makes more sense &amp; may have more beauty if you read it after reading Marco Polo's book; I think by reading Polo followed by Calvino, you get a lovely juxtaposition of described cities, real &amp; imagined, ugly &amp; beautiful, familiar &amp; esoteric.There has always been debate over whether or not Polo made his trek or if he was just a good storyteller (aided by his prison cellmate/scribe, a writer of adventure tales). I am wondering if Invisible Cities is Calvino's vote on the controversy. Invisible Cities describes many cities, yet, ultimately describes one city... Venice. So, is Calvino saying that Polo's account was the product of a good storyteller, one who was just presenting different facets of his home city, perhaps someone who never traveled very far at all yet could spin a good yarn?I think this book would make fascinating, if unusual, reading for college students going into urban planning &amp; development.Unique &amp; worth reading, especially if you have read Marco Polo's book.",2015-10-01 01:22:35,4,en,2015-10-01 01:22:35,10,2015,0.00068,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,181
Uday,"""On the day when I know all the emblems, "" he asked Marco, ""shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?"" And the Venetian answered : ""Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.""If, through several permutations and combinations, you can hint at the gap between what a human eye perceives, and the thing that he sets out to perceive, as artfully as Calvino does, the enterprise deserves not only justification, but demands a celebration. In a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan (Are they conversing? What signs? What language? What gestures? What methods?), several myths and architecture, one influencing the other are discussed at length, but with a depth which crosses through emotions, memories, and superstition - any of which you never thought would really inform you about a 'city'. The conversation is as entrancing as a Romantic poet's dream two hundred years ago, in which too, a 'pleasure-dome' is the subject. You may get through this and say, but did these sentences between Marco and Khan really spoken? ""It's the thought that counts"", Calvino would say.",2016-03-22 01:13:26,4,en,2016-03-22 01:13:26,3,2016,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,188
emma,"This book was unlike any other I've read. Invisible Cities doesn't have a traditional plot: it contains a series of descriptions of fictional cities, interspersed with interactions and dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. I was a little confused at first by the unusual structure and content, but the writing was wonderful. It's a beautifully-written book that has an almost whimsical feeling to it at times. There were a few moments when it started to feel repetitive to me, but there were also so many times that I found myself stumbling across unexpectedly profound lines and realizations. As a frequent traveler currently settling into a new home in a foreign city, I found this book especially relevant. It's definitely led to a lot of interesting reflections on the way I perceive new places in relation to my past homes and experiences, and has made me more conscious of the way I interact with my new surroundings.",2017-02-15 22:12:04,4,en,2017-02-15 22:12:04,2,2017,0.00057,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,157

Hollis,"An object that came to mind while reading this book was the Chinese finger trap. For those unfamiliar, in brief, it is a trap where, the more the user struggles, the tighter their finger(s) become trapped in the device. It is only by relaxing that the finger(s) can free themselves. The experience of being ensnared is a little hard to describe, but imagination must suffice. I could only really appreciate this book as a blur of sentences and brief glimpses (which it is), images and postcards. My struggles only took shape when I’d stop to ponder the purpose or meaning of individual cities and lines. Doing so would provoke a curious phrase, ""nonsense,"" the sort of response that approaches ""boring"" as empty reaction to the distance remaining between the individual and any object. Of course, is it possible for ""nonsense"" to function as a descriptor that isn't meant to condemn?I hadn't seen or thought of that contraption, the finger trap, in some time, and, on a whim, did some googling on the name's origin. That was a frustrating process in its own right, to see some references to Chinese court history with the toy (could be true, perhaps not) and other credits given to American inventors playing with exotic marketing methods (could also be true, perhaps not, but I'd lean towards this explanation). Thinking of this device and its name, as well as my (brief) attempt to find meaning behind the name, feels relevant when thinking back to Calvino's writing. There's a certain unknowability to these things, and, try as we might to give description and meaning, little sticks. I read and would come no closer to the object's true meaning/origin before moving on to a new attraction.We could approach this text as a meditation on exoticism, travel, memory, empire, dream, time, difference, distance... A log of names offered and all fitting. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan must have been deliberately chosen figures, though, when Kublai suggested, before ""Cities &amp; Eyes 5,"" that this could be a conversation taking place between two beggars, ""drunk on the few sips of bad wine,"" the following chapters did little to dispel that possibility. There is one exchange, after ""Continuous Cities 1,"" that felt especially meaningful:""...POLO: Unless porters, stonecutters, rubbish collectors, cooks cleaning the lights of chickens, washerwomen bent over stones, mothers stirring rice as they nurse their infants, exist only because we think them.KUBLAI: To tell the truth, I never think them.POLO: Then they do not exist.KUBLAI: To me this conjecture does not seem to suit our purposes. Without them we could never remain here swaying, cocooned in our hammocks.""Maybe the final bit is important to include, maybe not:""POLO: Then the hypothesis must be rejected. So the other hypothesis is true: they exist and we do not.KUBLAI: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be.POLO: And here, in fact, we are.""What does this say about the text as an exercise, and the practice of reading? That reading, and dreaming, are luxuries? The emperor cares little for those keeping the domain stable, and yet he continues his efforts, to expand and incorporate. Maybe there is something here, but we're soon bogged down by new cities and new directions, chess matches and inventories. Polo begins ""Thin Cities 5"" with, ""If you choose to believe me, good."" He doesn't add, ""If not, no matter,"" but I felt that to be Calvino's demeanor across the text.It's hard to find any footing here, but if there's one thing the text is good for, its the provoking of further questions. Is this about the allure or the horror of surfaces, names and labels? Is it pleasing to call this a novel, an experimental text, or a series of prose poems? If so, why? Why this fixation on labels, what is lost and gained? And what is the distinction between ""cities and names"" and ""cities and signs,"" ""cities and desire"" and ""cities and eyes""? Everyone has a favorite city, I'm not sure what mine would be.

Lesley,"Yay, another Calvino about reading and writing and signs and communication, full of riddles, logic games and stories within stories within stories. Hurrah! There’s no plot, just sets of very brief descriptions of baffling cities provided by the explorer Marco Polo, interspersed with dialogue between him and the emperor Kublai Khan. My hot take is the cities are texts, that each city is a text to be read, whose significance lies not in their architectural typology or socio-economic characteristics but in the symbolic meaning they hold, the interpretations they offer, the world that lies within. Yet the cities exist in isolation from one another, divorced from their landscape context, divorced from time and history, dots on a map of an empire. What do they all mean? All that connects them is being visited (in reality or in his imagination, you decide) by Polo. Marco Polo is the ultimate unreliable narrator-author. We can take it from the title that these cities may not be exactly real - but is it all fabrication? Are they all really just reimaginings of Venice? Why does he tell every audience different things? How does he know about airports? Does it even matter? And why ‘Invisible’? Invisible to Kublai Khan, who will never see the furthest reaches of his vast empire, or invisible as in they exist only in Marco Polo’s imagination? Questions, questions. And what of Kublai Khan, by turns captivated, exasperated, craving the traveller’s stories but also wanting Polo’s wild tales to conform to his maps and official knowledge? Is Khan the perplexed reader and Polo the trickster author, always one step ahead? Authors create fiction - untruths in other words - but we want credibility as well, untruths that we want to imagine as possible or at least enjoyably imaginable. Polo offers none of this, but still Khan needs more stories, while in obvious disbelief. It’s the reader-author relationship in a nutshell, Polo toying with Khan’s credulity in the same way Calvino plays so delightfully with ours.",2021-03-14 05:31:49,4,en,2021-03-14 05:31:49,3,2021,0.00228,0.0001,0.00025,0.00011,0.00024,0.00018,334
Zadie Loft,"It’s remarkable how many impossible things Calvino can firstly conceive—like Carroll’s White Queen did 6 times before breakfast—and then put into words, wonderful words at that. Calvino himself, in a lecture delivered in Turin in 1967, seemed to believe that impossibility is (one of) literature’s purpose(s): “The struggle of literature is in fact a statutory to escape from the confines of language; it stretches out from the utmost limits of what can be said; what stirs literature is the call and attraction of what is not in the dictionary.” [Calvino, The Literature Machine, 1989. Picador. tr. Patrick Creagh, p18] I think to write a proper review of Invisible Cities I would need to read it hundreds of times. I have a feeling that even if I devoted my whole life to understanding it (and is to be understood even its point?), I would never uncover its full potential. I’d also love to learn Italian well enough (Duolinguo has not got me there) to read it in its original tongue! My favourite cities (currently as I’m sure they will change on re-reading) are Zirma, the city that continuously changes in order to be remembered; Ersilia, ruins of an abandoned city containing only the strings of its inhabitants’ relationships; Baucis, the city which lives on stilts either out of hatred for Earth, respect for it, or a love for it before they existed; Adelma, the city where the inhabitants resemble those who are dead. A book that centres memory and imagination, Invisible Cities demands the same from its reader. To shrink it down into a single meaning or genre would be a disservice, in my opinion, so I would encourage anyone who hasn’t already to read it themselves. It might even be as if we are reading two different books. ‘“It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”’ [p123]",2021-01-05 17:30:42,5,en,2021-01-05 17:30:42,1,2021,0.00074,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,312
Alina,"This is a lot of fun to read. The book consists of dozens of vignettes of nominally different cities that the narrator Marco Polo has visited. Each vignette is written in the tone of a parable; it is highly stylized and poetic. But I found the literary quality of the vignettes to be inconsistent. Some wear a very obvious message on its sleeve, in a comparable manner by which Aesop's fables do. These are less beautiful and evocative; they rather feel formulaic, as if Calvino had a message about a way a city can conduct itself in mind, and arranged for particular symbols and events to articulate it. Other vignettes are more subtle, beautiful, and metaphorically resonant. There is a feeling, or glimpse into some aspect of reality, that each of these captures. It cannot be put straightforwardly into words. It evokes many diverse memories of places and experiences for the reader, and unifies them in an unexpected way. The images are incredibly creative and fresh.I wish the proportion of meaning to unmeaningful vignettes was better. I'd love this book a lot more if Calvino had just cut out all the formulaic ones, leaving the remaining dozen or so stellar ones present and gleaming. But instead, a reader has to comb through the many vignettes to find the good ones, which finally give transcendent reading experiences.",2021-07-29 02:29:52,4,en,2021-07-29 02:29:52,7,2021,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,226
ucha (enthalpybooks) ,"Reading this novel is like traveling without moving into Calvino’s imagined cities through a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Each city was beautifully described like prose poetry.Not only that, the writing structure in this book is amazed me. Total 55 cities (with all women’s names) were divided into 11 categories. The composition in the matrix box is a form of mathematical pattern that became characteristic of the Oulipo literary group that Calvino as one of their members.This thin book can be an unlimited source for interpretation such as Opera, Painting, Sculpture, Musical, and other art forms. It is a book that I will read again in the future and will insert other Calvino's works on my reading list.“With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear.

Sumirti Singaravelu,"It is the city which is not forbidden for the entry of anyone. It's frontiers are beyond the grasp of all those who enter. It is the city which dons on a cloak of imminence for all those who set their path onto it's gateway, yet they also know perpetually that it is a city enamored in transcendence. The city has neither a beginning nor an end. It's deepest alleys, winding boulevards, tremendous castles, lost homes, far away shores, the angular interceding pipes which connects and disconnects in its own fashion, the sudden holes which appear along it's walls, the walls which both compartmentalize and sets free, the lining mazes which often shows the way out but only in disguises, the houses which might have windows and doors where something precious is locked and never knocked, and those houses where it is perpetually knocked but with no desirable answers. It is the city where the traveler stumbles upon both the seen and the unseen. Those unseen might also appear to have the features and the characteristics of the seen, if only one care to notice. Those who enter the city are usually of varied kinds. There are those who enter those gates, which are never shut, to escape their own world; there is another a lot who enter not to leave the city to go back to their long abandoned lands; and there are those who reach the city with the dust of wonder circling their eyes, and only to take away the treasure which is abundantly given away in this glorious city to recreate their own world. Those of the first two kinds are the common lot found always, but the third kind is always rare and significant, just like the common truth found everywhere while the significant truth is rare. The city cast it beauty differently for different travelers, but it never becomes their own home, however, harder men try to make it so. That is it's boon and the bane. It is the place which is the same but not the same to everyone. Many wise men considers the city has the inkling of their precious childhood but only those who are great know it well that it grows precious only to the traveler who has already seen plethora of places, for every time one returns to it after a journey, the city looks abundant and sumptuous to the eye. It is the city which gives birth to the heaven and hell of men. Even more is it's glory. It gives raise to the Gods of men. Those who enter always long to return and there is none who has not left it half-hearted. The quintessence of mankind lies in its existence for the city sings his battles won. It is the city of Muse. It is the city in every man's mind. It is the human imagination. To take a tour through it's eternal paths and to enrich its experience alive, there was a man who left a treatise, a treasure, long ago. That is the book about which this review spins its words to explore. Take the journey for you are sure to stand adored and content with the magic lore.",2015-01-03 03:36:27,5,en,2015-01-03 03:36:27,1,2015,0.0014,0.00012,0.00022,0.00013,0.00021,0.00018,536
Jon,"Invisible Cities basically has everything I want out of a postmodern novel. Its philosophical dream narrative is delightfully sophisticated, but lacks any pretension. Italo Calvino dismantles the 'real' world and notions of certainty and absolutism with great charm and sly precision. Calvino refrains from elevating himself over others, either through self-praise or by diminishing others. Through his whimsical descriptions of the fantastic cities populating the great Kahn's kingdom, Calvino acknowledges that the world is a big, complex place, where no two cities, cultures, or people are alike. Consequently, Marco Polo's examination and description of each city reveals that to require every city and people to follow the same system of imperfect rules, designed by people incapable of creating a perfect system, presents serious problems.What most impresses me with Invisible Cities is how it pushes postmodernism without turning obnoxious, arrogant, lazy, mean, or stupid. Calvino's objective is not to destroy everything and declare there to be no god, no purpose, no center, and no reality. Instead, he seems to be amazed and delighted by the possibilities of a world unhinged from centralized, linear philosophy. He collapses time into one great now, wherein it becomes the individual's job to actualize their life and determine how they are to proceed. Truth becomes an elusive, tricky thing, but not absent from the world. If anything, Calivino seems to believe that our postmodern world creates more room for truth to exist, despite the bulk of mainstream thought (intellectual or otherwise) being saturated with over-determining half-truths and falsities. Finding personal truth becomes an obtainable challenge, where the first step is to recognize the limitations of our understanding, but to not then just throw in the towel and spout relativistic platitudes as over-determining as the allegedly irrelevant philosophies of past ages. To say nothing's real or true is just a lazy logical fallacy that Calvino avoids, which wins him big points with me. Instead, he writes one delightful piece of dream fantasy that is always smart and humorous, with a depth of feeling and compassion for humanity and the stumbling world we live in.",2011-05-25 22:36:02,5,en,2011-05-25 22:36:02,5,2011,0.01963,0.00016,0.00105,0.00026,0.00162,0.00063,347
Aishwarya Pant,"This is one of the most difficult books I've read. It's only about 150 pages but you have to stop every few pages, take a breath, try to take in what you've read. Because Calvino makes you pause. It's one of those books I'll come back to after a few years, and read it as a totally different book. Calvino has that effect on you. The book is set in 13th century China during the rule of the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan (grandson of Ghengis Khan). Among one of his explorers is the Venetian Marco Polo, who tells Kublai about life in cities that he has conquered. Almost every other page is a description of a different city. There are 55 in total (I had to search google for this). As the narration of the cities keeps going on, they start to start imaginary and made up. Magical elements creep into the stories. At one point, Kublai stops to him to say that it looks like Polo has never visited the cities he talks about. That he could make up one city too, but it doesn't mean it would come to life.I can try to describe this book further, but it wouldn't be fair to this book.“There is still one of which you never speak.'Marco Polo bowed his head.'Venice,' the Khan said.Marco smiled. 'What else do you believe I have been talking to you about?'The emperor did not turn a hair. 'And yet I have never heard you mention that name.'And Polo said: 'Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”The cities, to me, they didn't sound like Venice. But this conversation hit me hard. When you travel to places, when you start to live in other parts of the world, can you ever leave your past behind? Are you only projecting what you want to see? Do you ever really _see_ and _know_ the city and its people and its culture? Maybe you never do. Maybe you only end only visiting the city central, all the touristy places, eating the food and the wine someone recommended to you. You don't go to the suburbs, the zones 3-6 of London. Maybe I will never know this London, even if I live here for years.",2019-05-11 17:25:55,5,en,2019-05-11 17:25:55,5,2019,0.00181,0.0001,0.00021,0.00012,0.00021,0.00017,378
Adarsh Chauhan,"Invisible Cities is a kaleidoscope of human experience. This book is like an atlas of human imagination and goes from places as awe-inspiring as Kubla Khan's Xanadu, to places as horrifying as Dante's Inferno. It is both an evidence and a blueprint of human lives which becomes concrete through the places that we built and gets shape by the things we place to fill them. Like Marco Polo finding his beloved Venice in all the corners of the world that he travels, Calvino takes fragments of our lives' memories and creates a collage of unbelievable cities out of them by supplementing them with his imagination. So, while the title becomes almost too literal to bring any surprises, the tangible relation and familiarity with our own experiences materialises. When we imagine traveling to other cities, we imagine the lives of the people living there; in the same way, we visit Calvino's cities by looking at the dreams and fears of the people who inhabit them.What this collection and more particularly, the dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan end up evoking is also an interplay and interdependence between memories and dreams. We arrive at a nice contradiction when we think that dreams emerge out of imagination of experiences never had before, whereas how can we think of things which we have never experienced ever. If we ever try to dream, we are always stretching or compressing, collating or fragmenting, bits of our lives in ways which our memories and imagination can allow us. Memories become the matter of dreams and imagination is just the glue and scissors of how capably we can do it. Marco Polo's travels are happening in the physical realm or mental, it'll forever remain ambiguous. But Calvino's more interested in making the readers realise that our travels through space and time are metamorphosing our memories and evolving our dreams. And this makes neither the past concrete, nor the future certain - like the cities that we inhabit that we see constantly evolving or deteriorating, as we may take them to be.",2019-06-21 23:54:31,5,en,2019-06-21 23:54:31,6,2019,0.00088,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00016,344
Brian,"I just re-read this book after 5 or so years. What I had remembered about it was a cool book about Marco Polo describing Kublai Khan's empire to him by describing a long list of cities. After my first, brisk reading (it is a very short book) I didn't carry with me much else besides it being a cool ""exercise.""Upon re-reading, I was blown away. This book has it All. Everything.Every description of a city contains a great idea about memory, signs, interpretation, place, time, consciousness, reality, existence, death, life or any combination of these ideas. The book is very simply broken up in brief descriptions of cities, all with their own heading, and flipping through at random and reading any passage you can find some really great imaginative thought.I think it's totally brilliant. Basically every aspect of this book blew me away. From the concept to the actual writing (good translation I guess! some passages are just amazing).Interspersed at the beginning and end of each chapter is a dialogue between Polo and Khan which are also great, if you're the type that digs talking about existence/reality and so forth. But with such great imagination and writing, the book really goes beyond the ideas even, and just becomes an awesome bunch of writing. The themes really build on each other and (and I think this is something I've noticed in every book that I've loved) just ends in such a great way.This book just really captured my imagination. After every description I felt I could either immediately dig in to the next one or just sit back for a minute and let my mind wander. The book, not being hindered by standard story developments, I feel lets the reader bring a lot to it. So even just looking at it as a tool to provoke imagination it's still great.",2008-08-15 00:46:57,5,en,2008-08-15 00:46:57,8,2008,0.00063,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,309
Joshie,"""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.""There's not much of a plot in Invisible Cities but it's littered with beautiful and raw sentiments aboard a delicate prose. The cities told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan are mostly surreal and nonexistent. Each numbered chapter was further divided into sections titled Cities and Memory, Cities and Desire, Cities and Signs, Cities and the Dead, Thin Cities, Continuous Cities, Cities and Names, et cetera. They often ended abruptly, a tour cut short, and the longing lingered until one arrived at another. The cities were not described in terms of its wealth or its economy but by its people, its landscape, the wither and blossom done by time, the emotions it provoked and stirred within the narrator and the unnoticed things of the ordinary like lampposts, rats, their smell, and many more. The italicized fragments depicted the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan and were both special and strange. There was a comfortable silence partook in them. Invisible Cities was a mesmerising and in Marco Polo's often made-up, impossible cities came a reality which all of us have felt / seen.Overall, I did enjoy this book especially the sections of Cities and the Dead, Cities and Names and the exchange between Polo and Khan but I wanted to learn more about each city which made the experience a little bit underwhelming but wasn't there a danger in knowing to much? Perhaps cities were very similar to people.",2016-03-04 16:00:46,3,en,2016-03-04 16:00:46,3,2016,0.00093,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,286
Rick,"Marco Polo sits down to report on his travels to Kublai Khan, describing the many cities he’s visited or passed through across the emperor’s vast empire. The Khan is entertained, perplexed, mystified, and skeptical of Polo’s fanciful reports of cities, many with the names of women, and occasionally challenges his Venetian visitor to come some kind of clean. Polo however concedes every challenge but slyly spins off more fancy, “Sire,” he says when the Great Khan stops his narrative to turn the tables by describing a city that Polo will then have to confirm exists or not, “your mind has been wandering. This is precisely the city I was telling you about when you interrupted me.” Or, when the emperor says bluntly, “Your cities do not exist….I know well that my empire is rotting like a corpse in a swamp,” the Venetian acknowledges that the empire is sick and his mission is to find “the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed.” Not lies, as the emperor accused, but the hidden, fading to invisibility truth. Another time Polo replies to the emperor’s demand that he tell him about Venice by saying “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.” So all cities are one city, the city we know, love, loathe, flee, and return to. They are all former or future lovers; current, past or enemies to come. Our birthplace or cemetery. Dream or nightmare. Calvino weaves magic and mystery here and the reader is seduced in these brief, elegant descriptions and the chess match of conversation between host and visitor. Invisible Cities is a beautiful work of fiction.",2010-08-23 10:40:30,4,en,2010-08-23 10:40:30,8,2010,0.00183,0.0001,0.00019,0.00012,0.00022,0.00018,273
Sam,"Read this for an art seminar. Very interesting descriptions and thoughts of what actually constitutes a city. We will use this book as reference for our projects, and I'd say that I won't have problems finding something worthwile! I especially loved the synchronicity in some parts, layers upon layers of imagery: ""I could tell you how many steps make up the streets rising like stairways, and the degree of the arcades' curves, and what kind of zinc scales cover the roofs; but I already know this would be the same as telling you nothing. The city does not consist of this, but of relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its past: the height of a lamppost and the distance from the ground of a hanged usurper's swaying feet; the line strung from the lamppost to the railing opposite and the festoons that decorate the course of the queen's nuptial procession; the height of that railing and the leap of the adulterer who climbed over it at dawn; the tilt of a guttering and a cat's progress along it as he slips into the same window; the firing range of a gunboat which has suddenly appeared beyond the cape and the bomb that destroys the guttering; the rips in the fish net and the three old men seated on the dock mending nets and telling each other for the hundredth time the story of the gunboat of the usurper, who some say was the queen's illegitimate son, abandoned in his swaddling clothes there on the dock.""",2013-03-07 05:37:02,4,en,2013-03-07 05:37:02,3,2013,0.00069,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,260
Brian,"The building with the globes is now Fedora’s museum: every inhabitant visits it, chooses the city that corresponds to his desires, contemplates it, imagining his reflection in the medusa pond that would have collected the waters of the canal (if it had not been dried up), the view from the high canopied box along the avenue reserved for elephants (now banished from the city), the fun of sliding down the spiral, twisting minaret (which never found a pedestal from which to rise). [32] Marco, meanwhile , continued reporting his journey, but the emperor was no longer listening. Kublai interrupted him: “From now on I shall describe the cities and you will tell me if they exist and are as I have conceived them. I shall begin by asking you about a city of stairs, exposed to the sirocco, on a half-moon bay. Now I shall list some of the wonders it contains: a glass tank high as a cathedral so people can follow the swimming and flying of the swallow fish and draw auguries from them; a palm tree which plays the harp with its fronds in the wind; a square with a horseshoe marble table around it, a marble tablecloth, set with foods and beverages also of marble.”“Sire your mind has been wandering.

Amy | littledevonnook,"This was an interesting read for me as it's something I would never think to pick up myself. I was actually suggested to read this by a University lecturer as he thought it would help with my final project of the year - and alas it did!This very short novel tells of a series of conversations had between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Polo is telling Khan of the many cities and places that he has seen over the years, each place being more fantastical than the last.As the story goes on it seems possible that Polo is actually describing just one place; Venice. And that each revision of the city is in fact his warped and idyllic memory of the place rather than reality. The ideas of the imagination and memory are something that I really enjoyed thinking through whilst reading this book.Each chapter is only a couple of pages long which makes for a very quick yet thought-provoking read. Calvino really gets you to think and consider many things whilst exploring this novel which I really enjoyed. I found myself thinking of life and death, light and dark among other things like reality and fantasy.

Jasper Meer,"I picked this up after becoming immersed in urban planning, reading and swearing allegiance to the small-footprint, high density environmental ethics school my philosophy professor Dan Holbrook, a rancher, had so disparaged. Calvino's fabulist take on cities stresses on how cities can be encountered and how the same city can be encountered in a multiplicity of ways. And that's the trick I'd later argue with Professor Holbrook: it's not the structure of cities necessarily undercutting any environmental ethic, but the need to encounter and shape our cities with an environmental ethic in mind. Form can follow philosophy in this instance.Suburbs were a failed prototype of the garden cities we've begun to build. These new cities will reconcile what's best of the bucolic with the cosmopolitan, compared to the gated communities and strip malls that realized the worst of both. There won't be a pasture in Times Square anytime soon, but Calvino might have been able to imagine a day when it did and when it will.",2007-08-26 08:59:44,5,en,2007-08-26 08:59:44,8,2007,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,166
Adarsh Nargundkar,"Italo Calvino's writing lies on the thin line that separates the real from the realm of fantasy, but very much unlike the other works of magical realism you may have come across. Sure, he often talks of extraordinary occurrences. But even when speaks of the prosaic, the way he presents reality is so beautifully different that he infuses it with magic. And once having read Calvino you can never go back to looking at things the same way again. There's magic and breathtaking beauty in the most mundane of things. The cities that Marco describes to Kublai are dreamscapes that are more than just their physical manifestations. They are made of dreams and desires and memories. They are made up of qualities and intricate patterns hiding in plain sight. Read this book, not at once, but over many days.

Jaap,"The city has always been a fascinating model for human society. From the Great Babylon, the source of all evil, until the New Jerusalem with golden streets and pearl gates it appeals to humans as the realisation of dreams, bad or good. Italo Calvino provides a wonderful mixture of these dreams in this beautiful book as Marco Polo describes the cities he visited to his host Kublai Khan. Gradually the great Khan realises that the cities are dreams, images of Marco's Venice but aren't they also the images of the Khan's own dreams about his vast empire ? And while reading I come to realise that these cities also represent my own dreams about society, my hidden fears and my personal hopes. This is the best any book can achieve.

Sera,"Calvino is an Italian author who uses modern literary techniques to tell his stories. He uses this approach in Invisible Cities, and fails to disappoint. It's a travelogue of descriptions of cities as told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Calvino's descriptions are vivid, beautiful and precise. Calvino talks about the evolution of cities, how they take on the persona of their inhabitants, how the bright shine of the city fails to illuminate what may be actually going on under the surface, etc. I could go on and on but then, the reader won't be as pleasantly surprised as I was when reading this book.For a short book, there is much to contemplate here and how it remains extremely relevant today.I highly recommend this book.",2015-03-29 16:29:15,5,en,2015-03-29 16:29:15,3,2015,0.00061,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,125

M. Kirollos,"POLO: Perhaps this garden exists only in the shadow of your lowered eyelids, and we have never stopped: you, from raising dust on the fields of battle; and I, from bargaining for sacks of pepper in distant bazaars. But each time we half-close our eyes, in the midst of the din and the throng, we are allowed to withdraw here, dressed in silk kimonos, to ponder what we are seeing and living, to draw conclusions, to contemplate from the distance.KUBLAI: Perhaps this dialogue of ours is taking place between two beggars nicknamed Kublai Khan and Marco Polo; as they sift through a rubbish heap, piling up rusted flotsam, scraps of cloth, wastepaper, while drunk on the few sips of bad wine, they see all the treasure of the East shine around them.POLO: Perhaps all that is left of the world is a wasteland covered with rubbish heaps, and the hanging garden of the Great Khan's palace. It is our eyelids that separate them, but we cannot know which is inside and which outside.That’s a taste of what you’ll find in the poetic descriptions of imagined cities by Marco Polo and his conversations with Kublai Khan.Only in Marco Polo's accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites' gnawing.Perhaps the most eccentric book I’ve ever read to date, and certainly the most difficult to describe. I really found it challenging at times to go through till the end and at some pointI thought I'll never do it. To be honest that was because of the magical descriptions of some cities that forced me to re-read over and over again and I seemed never to progress, which, thinking about it now, might not have been necessarily a bad thing.Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man's place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.""Journeys to relive your past?"" was the Khan's question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: ""Journeys to recover your future?""And Marco's answer was: ""Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.""I enjoyed it for most parts but maybe I'll appreciate it more in a different age, time, location, or state-of-mind. I generally blame the bustling London for my diminishing capability of tasting poetry and books of this nature, or probably I needed to find the substance Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, or rather Calvino, were smoking. ""And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced,"" Kublai said. ""It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations.""""I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others,"" Marco answered. ""It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.""I must say though that I found some city descriptions to be just ludicrous and too gaudy and tacky by any means and with any state of mind, of course one doesn't expect all the poems in a book to be up to the same level or to taste all of them equally, but at some point I had to say this is absolute nonsense; The emperor has no clothes and all that glistens is not gold. But some other cities were just brilliant; Mauralia, the metropolis, formerly provincial city, is one of them:Beware of saying to them that sometimes different cities follow one another on the same site and under the same name, born and dying without knowing one another, without communication among themselves. At times even the names of the inhabitants remain the same, and their voices' accent, and also the features of the faces; but the gods who live beneath names and above places have gone off without a word and outsiders have settled in their place. It is pointless to ask whether the new ones are better or worse than the old, since there is no connection between them, just as the old post cards do not depict Maurilia as it was, but a different city which, by chance, was called Maurilia, like this one.Descriptions of cities at times were descriptions of human emotions and experiences. Each city gives the readers something to think about, and some will resonate with their experience.Chloe, Eutropia were memorable, as well as Baucis, Leandra. I found the cities of the dead to be particularly intriguing, my favourite of which is Adelma:I thought: ""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.""The stevedores climbed the steps in a line, bent beneath demijohns and barrels; their faces were hidden by sackcloth hoods; ""Now they will straighten up and I will recognise them,"" I thought, with impatience and fear. But I could not take my eyes off them; if I turned my gaze just a little toward the crowd that crammed those narrow streets, I was assailed by unexpected faces, reappearing from far away, staring at me as if demanding recognition, as if to recognise me, as if they had already recognised me. Perhaps, for each of them, I also resembled someone who was dead. I had barely arrived at Adelma and I was already one of them, I had gone over to their side, absorbed in that kaleidoscope of eyes, wrinkles, grimaces.I thought: ""Perhaps Adelma is the city where you arrive dying and where each finds again the people he has known. This means I, too, am dead."" And I also thought: ""This means the beyond is not happy.""A recommended read for the dreamers and poetry fans out there , but like other works of similar nature, it definitely needs a contemplating mood and a quiet location away from the city; maybe in the country or in a park, under a tent in the middle of wilderness or lying on a beach. Otherwise, in a bus for instance, it will sound ridiculous (or more ridiculous than it really is if you don’t like it)Cecilia the continuous city, Olinda the city that grows in concentric circles were special. Irene as well:If you saw it, standing in its midst, it would be a different city; Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes.For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is a city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.Eusapia; another dead cityThey say that this has not just now begun to happen: actually it was the dead who built the upper Eusapia, in the image of their city. They say that in the twin cities there is no longer any way of knowing who is alive and who is dead.Raissa, the unhappy cityAlso in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.Thekla:If you ask ""Why is Thekla's construction taking such a long time?"" the inhabitants continue hoisting sacks, lowering leaded strings, moving long brushes up and down, as they answer ""So that it's destruction cannot begin."" And if asked whether they fear that, once the scaffoldings are removed, the city may begin to crumble and fall to pieces, they add hastily, in a whisper, ""Not only the city.""Trude:""You can resume your flight whenever you like,"" they said to me, ""but you will arrive at another Trude, absolutely the same, detail by detail. The world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end. Only the name of the airport changes.""And Perinthia; the city that was modelled following astronomer’s calculations:Perinthia's astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in the city of monsters.I re-read the book trying to contain it entirely in my mind. Reading it quickly, I thought, might present a better view; since patterns and forms are better discerned at a distance. Then a third time to extract my favorite parts, and started to realize it’s not nearly as bad as I might thought at times, and that I will probably revisit it again in the future, perhaps then I will be able to find the meanings that eluded me, or I’ll learn how to imagine clothes to put on the emperor’s naked body.Kublai asks Marco, ""When you return to the West, will you repeat to your people the same tales you tell me?""""I speak and speak,"" Marco says, ""but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""And a perfect endingHe said: ""It is all useless, if the last landing place can only be the infernal city, and it is there that, in ever-narrowing circles, the current is drawing us.""And Polo said: ""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""",2012-04-03 05:37:03,4,en,2012-04-03 05:37:03,4,2012,0.00673,0.00011,0.0004,0.00014,0.00054,0.0003,1991
charles,"invisible cities' extremely impressive adherence to its structure is, in my opinion, both its greatest strength and achilles' heel. the good stuff first, though.fundamentally invisible cities is the literary equivalent of a set of theme and variations, and whilst there are better examples, i'm immediately reminded of bach's goldberg variations -- bach's work is bookended by an identical opening and closing canon with myriads of variations between, whilst calvino likewise bookends his work by creating an intricate structure of conical expansion and contraction with spiralling variations in between. it's both stylistically beautiful, on a ""meta"" level that proves how absurdly talented the oulipo group were at their game, as well as narratively, tracking the ebbing and flowing of the novel's various themes as they are simultaneously introduced, expounded and left behind. calvino has constructed a kind of city, a borgesian labyrinth within the structure of the novel itself, if you will. that it succeeds at all and reads cohesively without conscious attention to its experimental structure is a marvel of literary ingenuity.anyhow, invisible cities stuns with its flashes of poetic brilliance (and there are many such flashes, calvino really is a master of succintness, and if this novel proves anything it's that i ought to read his short stories someday), but i find its repetition ultimately impeding, especially when its 55 cities mostly follow a similar pattern of description, a larger-than-life city adhering to a particular feature, often surreal or fantastical in nature, and the introduction of various ironies by which said feature clouds one's perception of the city as a whole.nevertheless, that it only occasionally feels redundant or overreaching is a testament to calvino's gifts as a writer and his uniquely playful and exploratory approach to postmodernism as a whole (ugly word, but allow me regardless). still it's a great novel on the whole, one which deserves to be read and loved both for its many triumphs and the necessary flaws its structure behoves. permitting me to be musically sacrilegious, i've never quite enjoyed the goldberg variations as much as i know i'm obliged to for this same reason.bonus: if you want to embark on the ultimate postmodern date, find a partner willing to tolerate an absurd amount of your bullshit, then find the longest bus route in your city and read invisible cities cover to cover with them during the entire duration, optimally finishing the book at the same time as the bus reaches its terminus. then ride the exact same route back, this time discussing the novel and reliving it entirely through the lens of mutual critique. calvino would approve.",2022-10-29 02:33:49,3,en,2022-10-29 02:33:49,10,2022,0.01422,0.00041,0.01043,0.00033,0.0017,0.00043,433
Jemma Dixon,"I'm sort of at a loss for words with this book . . . It was less than I expected it would be, although it did make me think things I'd never thought of before. The fact I'll be in Venice this year feels as surreal as the novel itself. All I can say, is that what exists outside of our existence (like, things we have never seen before), how can we know that it's real? What truly exists? Social media has expanded our lives outward so much that we don't just have our own microcosmic worlds to mull over, we have far reaching cities and distant islands and places we, quite literally, could never have imagined. What if we sit and stare and see the patterns of ourselves reflected in these places? What if there is a part of us that knows some cities are only to be visited once, never to return to? Or we can return, but that initial meeting is never quite the same. I'm meeting someone really special to me in Paris this year - is this real? How is that real? It doesn't feel real... neither does the book. It's all thought, conception, ideas, mirrored reflections. Are cities what we make of them? What we bring to it? There's this perpetual sense of always missing something, even when I'm at home or overseas - I wonder what will fill it up. Maybe dreams or cities or bright eyed stares from strangers in foreign lands... I have no idea. Calvino has so much to unpack, I'm not sure where to start, and I don't think I want to. The experience was enough. I'd still return to this book a tourist. I'm a tourist of my own self, so of course I'll never feel like I can fully discover anything -- there's a happy kind of magic in that.

Sunny,"Maybe I had a bad translation of this book but I didn’t see what was so amazing about it. I loved Calvino’s baron in the woods but this one was a little off the mark for me or maybe I didn’t getted it. It’s about a series of discussions between Kublai Khan the Mongol leader and Marco Polo the explorer. In the discussion Marco Polo basically describes the cities that he has seen on his travels to the Khan – most of them are made up and pretty incredible sounding. Magical realism / utopian in a way but for some reason I didn’t get into them – maybe I don’t like short stories. One of the brilliant cities Marco describes is called Eutropia and I would love to try that if I ever ruled England or became Mayor of London:•	“Eutropia is not one, but all these cities together; only one is inhabited at a time, the others are empty; and this process is carried out in rotation. Now I shall tell you how. On the day when Eutropia’s inhabitants feel the grip of weariness and no one can bear any longer his job, his relatives, his house and his life, debts, the people he must greet or who greet him, then the whole citizenry decides to move to the next city, which is there waiting for them, empty and good as new; there each will take up a new job, a different wife, will see another landscape on opening his window, and will spend his time with different pastimes, friends, gossip.”",2017-03-06 06:01:39,3,en,2017-03-06 06:01:39,3,2017,0.00078,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,261

Val Timke,"Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" is more than poignant--it is accessible. I find that it is not flowerily pretentious for a book that is literally describing dozens of different cities, each given only 1-3 pages.The ideas in this story are unique. Some of my favorite cities were the ones that involved mirror cities. When I started a new mirror city story, a part of me felt it had already been done before in another city, but only for a moment. Then, Calvino complicated the expected. I loved the ends of these mirror city stories--they all further complicated the appearance of these cities. It is true, a few of the cities are less interesting than the others. But I think there only ended up being a couple I didn't feel strongly about, not enough for me to have enjoyed it as less than a five-star read.This book is fast-paced, poetic, and as mentioned before, accessible. I'd recommend this in a heartbeat. Up next for me: Calvino's ""The Baron in the Trees.""

However, I saw Invisible Cities in my favourite Cambridge book shop and thought I'd dive back into Calvino's wonderfully wacky work.This book appealed to me as it focuses on the city of Venice but in a surreal and fractured way that I feel Calvino carries throughout his works. The descriptions of these strange and magical locations were great vignettes, giving you insight into other worlds. Written in chapters of two pages at the longest, this book is quick to get through but I enjoyed savouring it, reading it in three chunks.Overall, I prefer this book to If on a winter's night a traveller and since I really enjoyed that one, I'm excited to try more by this author.5 out of 5 stars!",2020-03-11 07:31:49,5,en,2020-03-11 07:31:49,3,2020,0.00065,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,146
Rishi,"Invisible Cities is not one book, but two. The first exists in the distance, sitting closed on your bedside table. The second takes over your reality, its spine cracked open in your hands. Each acknowledges a different version of you. While it sits closed on your bedside table you are one kind of person: a part-former, part-future reader with memories of what you have already read and intuitions about what you will read next. While the book is open in your hands, you are someone else: a puzzle-solver and a skeptic, a romantic and an eavesdropper, listening in on a grand conversation between an aging emperor named Kublai Khan and an imaginative merchant named Marco Polo. In either case, you are a person in love with a book. A magical book, full of poetry, which strives to examine everything from the deception of memory to the subversion of death. In one moment, it's a breezy journal from a faraway place. In another, it's a profound discussion of ontology and mereology, of what it is to be, to be a part of, to be made of parts. Or maybe it's all of these things at once, in the very same moment. A dream.",2019-03-16 01:48:13,5,en,2019-03-16 01:48:13,3,2019,0.01802,0.0001,0.00052,0.00021,0.0013,0.00031,202
Heather Henderson,"Every once in a while I read a book that when I put it down, I immediately know that I want to re-read it. This is one of them. I want to re-read this slowly, over the course of a month, savoring each city and thinking about the meaning in the description of each. This book is more poetic prose than novel, there is a very loose plot but the book is essentially descriptions of 50+ fictitious cities. Some of the cities have such interesting ideas that they could be entire books or short stories in themselves if expanded upon. Expect a re-read later in this year with an extended review.

cassia,"Started this in college for a 4D media arts class and only got around to finishing it this month, but I’m glad I did. I don’t quite know how to describe this book with coherent ideas but at times, it gave me this sense of visceral weightlessness, like that moment when you hit a large bump in the road and you’re not sure if you’re still going up or coming back down. The subversion of expectation and perception struck me deeply on an emotional level that I’m always looking for in a novel.

Whit,"4.5 - Maybe 5 given time.This is a hugely important book. I wish it had been in my possession this time last year, I believe if it had it would have provided some kind solace in light of living in a society that was deteriorating around me. A year on, this novel is no less important, but I am perhaps viewing through a different lens - to say this is an examination of society is reductive, it is far more - mystical - than that. It bathes in the things which sociology cannot explain, it examines the mystery that is human existence with warmth and affection - finding ways that even the detritus of our lives make up the whole of the Human Soul.This is a work of profound mysticism. I am inclined to say it is one of the best books I have ever read - I shall most certainly be returning to it in time. Thank you Caspar for this gift.

Sam,"The occasion of my awarding five stars to anything here is a rare one, but Invisible Cities just about wins my heart.If you open books hoping for the usual bombardment of clichés necessary to hold together a riveting story or one of the usual old formulaic plots, then Invisible Cities isn’t something you’ll appreciate. If, on the other hand, you enjoy the experience of reading purely for its own sake then you may very well be enchanted by this magical little book.In creating this fictional communion between the emperor Kublai Khan and travelling merchant Marco Polo the author has devised a playground in which he can run away with all of his imaginings and inventions without having to adhere to the comparatively predictable conventions of plot and narrative, enabling the book to confidently hold what are often beautiful and captivating abstractions in the form of pure prose. Calvino has such a magnificent way of presenting his words and descriptions that you may very well find yourself blown along, if your sails are so positioned, into the midst of his creation where you will drift pleasurably until the books end.Attempting to describe what this book consists of isn’t the easiest of tasks. So here is one of the city descriptions of which it consists:Summoned to lay down the rules for the foundation of Perinthia, the astronomers established the place and the day according to the position of the stars; they draw the intersecting lines of the decumanus and the cardo, the first oriented to the passage of the sun and the other like the axis on which the heavens turn. They divided the map according to the twelve houses of the zodiac so that each temple and each neighbourhood would receive the proper influence of the favoring constellations; they fixed the point in the walls where gates should be cut, foreseeing how each would frame an eclipse of the moon in the net thousand years. Perinthia - they guaranteed - would reflect the harmony of the firmament; nature’s reason and the gods’ benevolence would shape the inhabitants destinies.Following the astronomers’ calculations precisely, Perinthia was constructed; various peoples came to populate it; the first generation born in Perinthia began to grow within its walls; and these citizens reached the age to marry and have children.In Perinthia’s streets and square today you encounter cripples, dwarfs, hunchbacks, obese men, bearded women. But the worse cannot be seen; guttural howls are heard from cellars and lofts, where families hide children with three heads or six legs.Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in the city of monsters.It is treasures like this which Invisible Cities contains. Here is another:Those who arrive at Thekla can see little of the city, beyond the plank fences, the sackcloth screens, the scaffoldings, the metal armatures, the wooden catwalks hanging from ropes or supported by sawhorses, the ladders, the trestles. If you ask, “Why is Thekla’s construction taking such a long time?” the inhabitants continue hoisting sacks, lowering leaded strings, moving brushes up and down, as they answer, “So that its destruction cannot begin.” And if asked whether they fear that, once the scaffoldings are removed, the city may begin to crumble and fall to pieces, they add hastily, in a whisper, “Not only the city.”If, dissatisfied with the answers, someone puts his eye to a crack in the fence, he sees cranes pulling up other cranes, scaffoldings that embrace other scaffoldings, beams that prop up other beams. “What meaning does your construction have?” he asks. “What is the aim of a city under construction unless it is a city? Where is the plan you are following, the blueprint?”“We will show it to you as soon as the working day is over, we cannot interrupt our work now,” they answer.Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars. “There is our blueprint,” they say.This may well strike you as abstract waffle. But to me it is refreshing to have finally found an author, having recently forced myself to wade through some of the more unbearably boring and repetitive passages of William Burroughs’ Cities of the Red Night, who can write non-narrative fiction in a convincing and uplifting way. It is one of the most original books I have ever read. If the passages above strike you as interesting then you should certainly read this. But if it strikes you as boringly pretentious experimentalism then you should seek your fulfilment elsewhere. As for me, I fell in love with it. I have very rarely been compelled to award something five stars, as my idea of what constitutes a five star book is obviously very different from that of the majority of people here who would award it equally to Don Quixote and Harry Potter, but Invisible Cities has undoubtedly earned them all.NOTE: This is a review of the William Weaver translation.",2012-08-09 17:57:36,5,en,2012-08-09 17:57:36,8,2012,0.00201,0.0001,0.00021,0.00013,0.00025,0.00019,849

Flybyreader,"“Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”This fantasy-travelogue is a hard one both read and review.

Matt,"…Marco’s answers and objections took their place in a discourse already proceeding on its own, in the Great Khan’s head. That is to say, between the two of them it did not matter whether questions and solutions were uttered aloud or whether each of the two went on pondering in silence. In fact, they were silent, their eyes half-closed, reclining on cushions, swaying in hammocks, smoking long amber pipes.	Marco Polo imagined answering (or Kublai Khan imagined his answer) that the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there…Borges and Calvino. Two of the most fascinating, intelligent and unique authors of the 20th century. Throughout various forums across the internet Calvino is one of the only authors whose name is often referred to in the same light as Jorge Luis Borges, so I’ve finally got around to reading some of his work. I spent the last week reading Invisible Cities and there is no doubt that this book echoes a variety of Borgesian tropes.The book is essentially a fantastic re-imagining of Marco Polo’s conversations with the great Chinese emperor Kublai Khan. It describes a collection of weird and wonderful imaginary cities visited by Marco Polo on his travels, descriptions which are broken up by a string of airy, meditative conversations between the Venetian merchant and the emperor. What Calvino does brilliantly in Invisible Cities is to blend the boundaries of fiction and reality; he conjures up the image of a world where life and death meld together, dreams and waking life overlap, and future, past, and present intermingle seamlessly. Each city is like a meditation on some aspect of reality, yet, in a truly Borgesian fashion, almost none of the descriptions go over the length of a page or two.Indeed Calvino himself is the first to recognise the importance of Borges in his writing: …critics of Borges feel bound to observe that each of his texts doubles or multiplies its own space through the medium of other books belonging to a real or imaginary library, whether they be classical, erudite, or merely invented.What I particularly wish to stress is how Borges achieves his approaches to the infinite without the least congestion, in the most crystalline, sober, and airy style.And here what is true for Borges is also true for Calvino. Borges creates an infinite, imaginary, invisible library, a library that is all libraries. Calvino creates an infinite, imaginary, invisible city, a city that is all cities:I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others … It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists.In his 1951 essay ‘Coleridge's Dream’ Borges describes that Kublai Khan built a palace according to a plan that he had seen in a dream and retained in his memory: ‘A Mongolian emperor, in the thirteenth century, dreams a palace and builds it according to his vision’. So seeing the inspiration Calvino takes from his Argentinian predecessor perhaps it’s not surprising that Invisible Cities reads like a Borges story extended to the length of a small novel. Perhaps he came across the dreams of Kublai Khan through Borges, or perhaps Calvino never read Borges' essay and the book of cities just appeared to him in a dream…The story of two dreams is a coincidence, a line drawn by chance, like the shapes of lions or horses that are sometimes formed by clouds.Either way I loved Invisible Cities, I loved it's magical imagery, and I loved the way Calvino plays games with time and space. It's one of the few books that I've read and been immediately excited to read it again second time. Maybe I'll pick it up when I'm lost in unfamiliar quarters of a distant city, and through reading it I will understand the other cities I crossed to arrive there.",2014-11-03 14:05:21,5,en,2014-11-03 14:05:21,11,2014,0.00087,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,672

Filipe,"A quite disorienting caleidoscope of words. And also of cities that exist and don't exist. I guess there is something playing around here, a joke about contradictions that exist deep in the human heart and that translates itself to the geometry of cities and of life. As I read it, I couldn't forget the novel The Glory of the Empire, written by Jean d'Ormesson and it's imaginative tale about an empire and the cities that inhabit it: an empire of various multiplicities of peoples and ethnicities and the hopes, fears, love and violence that constituted this fictional empire, and because it is human it could contain all that. I also remembered some of the exquisite closing sections of The Cabala written by the great Thornton Wilder, in which the spirit of Dante Alighieri provides some advice for the protagonist:""Know, importunate barbarian, that I spent my whole lifetime under a great delusion, -that Rome and the house of (emperor) Augustus were eternal. Nothing is eternal save Heaven. Romes existed before Rome and when Rome will be a waste there will be Romes after her. Seek out some city that is young. The secret is to make a city, not to rest in it.

Edita,"When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.*“Journeys to relive your past?” was the Khan’s question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: “Journeys to recover your future?” And Marco’s answer was: “Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”*It is the mood of the beholder which gives the city of Zemrude its form. If you go by whistling, your nose a-tilt behind the whistle, you will know it from below: window sills, flapping curtains, fountains. If you walk along hanging your head, your nails dug into the palms of your hands, your gaze will be held on the ground, in the gutters, the manhole covers, the fish scales, wastepaper. You cannot say that one aspect of the city is truer than the other, but you hear of the upper Zemrude chiefly from those who remember it, as they sink into the lower Zemrude, following every day the same stretches of street and finding again each morning the ill-humor of the day before, encrusted at the foot of the walls. For everyone, sooner or later, the day comes when we bring our gaze down along the drainpipes and we can no longer detach it from the cobblestones. The reverse is not impossible, but it is more rare: and so we continue walking through Zemrude’s streets with eyes now digging into the cellars, the foundations, the wells.",2016-06-28 17:23:46,3,en,2016-06-28 17:23:46,6,2016,0.00517,0.00011,0.00033,0.00016,0.0004,0.00027,369
Bob Newman,"Polo Ties Khan in Filosofical FinalBack in the days of my wasted youth I was really into ZAP COMIX. For those readers unfamiliar with that august publication, the content was ""highly varied"" but almost always politically incorrect. One kind of page aimed at readers who did not flinch from inhaling certain controlled substances. There would be, for example, a house and garden in a cartoon box. In each successive box, a little bit more would disappear. In the next to last box, there would be a tiny circle, made into a `yang and yin' design and in the last box it would go ""plink"" or ""poing !"" and there would be nothing at all left. INVISIBLE CITIES brought these stoner cartoons to mind, because what you get out of the book (or the cartoons) is mainly what is already inside you. Marco Polo regales Kublai Khan with endless tales of the different cities he has visited while travelling round the great Mongol Empire. Each city bears a woman's name and some possess modern features never seen in the Venetian's lifetime. The description of each city gives some kind of philosophical essence, so that what we are really reading is a kind of compound of Calvino's imagination and deep thoughts melded together into a kind of literary pill. It's up to you if you want to swallow it. ""Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches."" he intones. ""The unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence."" There's hundreds of mantras like this, kind of literary Chinese fortune cookies written by Khalil Gibran. In the end, Marco admits that he's made up these descriptions, but says that if the two of them did not ""think the cities and their inhabitants"", they would not exist. The Khan agrees. If such sentiments and literary directions are your bag, then this could be a very interesting book. I note that the majority of reviewers were people who liked the book. This is not always the best guide for surfers with questions. For my part, I grew tired of the repetitive format, the somewhat shopworn philosophy.

Tim Pendry,"I am really struggling with Calvino. For some absurd existentialist reason, I am working through his texts in the perhaps vain hope of finding something that is truly interesting in his work. This is supposed to be one of his greatest texts and one suspects that it might have been revelatory in some way at the time of writing but, increasingly, one's impression is that Calvino represents a moment in history when all the talk was of semiotics and not of substance.Calvino seems to represent an experimentation that is heading nowhere. He is clever but he is dull. He expects us to engage intellectually with his thought processes but it all seems scarcely worth the effort since much of what substance there is represents a philosophical platitude.The contrast with the subtleties of Di Lampedusa are striking and the revolt against the bourgeois novel only appears to have led to an incomprehensible bourgeois experimentation.It is fair to say that Calvino, when he chooses to be lucid, can write brilliantly on occasions and those moments keep this book in the library - whereas his 'Castle of Crossed Destinies' is now on the pile for the second hand bookshop.Perhaps he is best seen as a prose poet and coherence not expected of him - in which case, I am, sadly, the wrong reader for him since I like discipline and clarity rather than the second-guessing of another mind or the performance art of reading a book as if I were writing it.There is one other thing to say in his favour. He does have a fertile imagination for the unusual concept or image - it is understandable why he is respected as creative in fantasy circles but what the reader begs for is that these remarkable short prose poems to be turned into narrative.I shall persist with perhaps two more texts ... I like to give a man the benefit of the doubt but this is becoming tiring.",2012-08-19 18:52:03,3,en,2012-08-19 18:52:03,8,2012,0.00098,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,325
Ella,"My memory of this book a month later is almost like the memory of a particularly good guided meditation (OK, I don't have a ton of experience with good guided meditation, but I know bad ones!) This is a nifty book. It seems so simple: Marco Polo telling tales to Kublai Khan about his travels through the Mongol Empire, with some notable additions. So there's a realm where it's a bit like a travelogue to all the cities I've visited, lived in, loved or have wished to see - a wonderful imaginative experience. And there's another realm where it's philosophy about cities, humankind, differences and similarities, the changes that happen over time both physically and mentally - and this is the part where the meditation comes in. It's a wonderful book that I wasn't sure I wanted to read before I started. It starts slowly, but once you start to see what's happening between the two main characters and the world in which we all live, it starts to seem almost too short.It also made me very curious about a lot of things and one of the best things I found along the way was a course curriculum for school students based on this book: http://teachers.yale.edu/curriculum/v...and the Yale National Initiative seminar ""Invisible Cities: The Arts and Renewable Community"": http://teachers.yale.edu/curriculum/v...Those are just two things I thought were kind of awesome, but there are other nonfiction books and all sorts of memory/artistic and other creative projects that tie into this book. You could spend a lifetime doing nothing but reading related texts.

Alicia,"I had a love-hate relationship with this novel(la). One of the reasons it took me so long to get through even though it's super skinny. I think what I didn't like about it is that it is quite abstract, if a novel can even be abstract that is. I have never been able to even get close to appreciating abstract art in any form. Also it had more the feeling of a set of very short stories rather than one coherent novel, and I am just not such a huge fan of short stories, James Joyce being a huge exception there. What I did like about it is Calvino's beautiful writing style, he has a way of describing something and leaving you completely mesmerised. If I could call somebody's prose perfect, I would say his is pretty close, and I'm not even reading it in the original language.Something that did add to my experience of reading this book was that I'd read Marco Polo's Travels, which this book certainly reflects on and in a way also comments on. I think at some point I will definitely reread when I have more time to think about what exactly the point is that Calvino is trying to get at, which right now, for me, is still quite unclear. Some of the ideas in there I understood and find interesting, like that it is the listener who creates the image of a city, or in other words it is the reader who creates the story. Also the idea that all cities are 'the same'. Definitely some things to ponder over there.",2016-11-23 08:02:28,3,en,2016-11-23 08:02:28,11,2016,0.00092,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,268
Euan,"Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino just blew me out the water. Easily one of the top books I've read this year. The only books I'm sure I liked more are Gormenghast and Viricionium. It might fall just below Piranesi depending on how my feelings settle after the ""honeymoon phase.""For such a small book, it packs such a large punch. There's so much to enjoy in such a little package- beautiful prose, poetic elements, structural fun, evocative vignettes, philosophical dialogues. Each of the cities described in just a couple pages are whimsical and imaginative, unique and interesting, but tied together in a web of thematic threads. It's like a bunch of mini snapshots of Gormenghasts and Viriconiums, New Crobuzons and Ankh-Morporks.I highly recommend giving Invisible Cities a go to anyone who loves evocative settings, structural fun, and classical dialogues. It lies somewhere in fantasy, magical realism, and literary fiction.I don't know that this is a properly coherent, descriptive review, but I was just sort of blindsided by how of much I enjoyed this. You always hope that each and every read is going to be a new favourite, but this is the most I've been surprised by how much I enjoyed a book in a long while.

Lara Messersmith-Glavin,"I keep a copy of this around to use in the way some use tarot cards, or willow sticks or coins to throw the Yi Ching. I can open this book to any page, in any mood, with a question or somtimes simply a hollow heart, and there will be the story I need. Each city, each description (whispered to Kublai Khan to tell him of the vastness of his empire, most of which he will neither ever see nor understand...) is like an answer unto itself, a little meditation on a possible life. Some are as long as three or four pages; most are not, covering only the page and a half that offers itself when the spine is cracked, stopping short on the right so you have a place for your thumb.It never occurred to me to read it straight through, and so I never have. Perhaps it is different that way, although I somehow doubt it.This is a gorgeous book, a mysterious book, a book full of so many images and ideas and little strange thoughts that it seems like too many truths for one brain to have crafted. It is a pocket jewel. It makes me want to be a better writer, a weirder human, a more beautiful thing.

Dfordoom,"My favourite of Italo Calvino’s books. It consists of a series of impressionistic portraits of imaginary and possible cities described by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. The cities are all fantastic flights of fantasy but they all represent some aspect of the idea of a city, or some way of looking at a city, or some way in which we think of cities or give names to our ideas of cities. They also represent ways of looking at human societies and life and death and the ways in which we comprehend the world and give shape to our understanding of the world. The cities are often bizarre, and some are uninhabited. Some never were, or could be, inhabited. Some are cities of the dead. Some are cities that can never be reached. Some of them are simply states of mind. One of the things that Calvino is preoccupied with is the way we try to impose order on the world by naming things, and he’s interested in the relation between the names we give things and the things themselves and the things they represent to our minds. It might sound esoteric but Calvino has a way of making postmodernism gloriously entertaining. It’s really more like an extended prose poem than a novel but it’s absolutely enthralling. The prose is gorgeous, the cities are magnificent.",2008-04-04 13:11:17,5,en,2008-04-04 13:11:17,4,2008,0.00074,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,224
Caspar Bryant,"'...Polo answers, 'Traveling, you realise that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name.'The above quote hopefully demonstrates the quiet beauty of Calvino's prose. I think much of this arises from a tendency to understate. A review is (for me) a manner of infraction - so this is a little daunting. I love this book, and refuse to muddy the waters through redundant use of terms such as 'kaleidoscopic' or 'concentric'.Invisible Cities will invite comparisons to Escher, Scheherazade, Borges, and Dali. Something about this frustrates me - perhaps to do with the impulse to compartmentalise. But I can't deny there is a validity to these comparisons.Calvino always invites the reader (sometimes teasingly) to participate in his narratives, and I think this novel is perhaps the key example of this. Read it. I promise you won't regret doing so.",2020-08-23 20:50:58,5,en,2020-08-23 20:50:58,8,2020,0.00077,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,171

Al,"This is a stunning book that uses the most beautiful prose, thanks not only to Calvino as author, but especially to William Weaver as the translator. The book describes conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan on the different cities that Marco polo has encountered, always teasing the reader, and Khan himself, as to whether these are real places or not. He describes the architecture and the citizens in a way that reminds me of fantastical stories or fairy tales, as well as contemplating internal emotional reactions which probe deeply and in many different directions. The prose is poetic and I think requires multiple readings to tease out all of the layers of description. I felt that this was such a refreshing interlude among what I normally read, and I strongly recommend this book.",2019-12-29 20:41:22,5,en,2019-12-29 20:41:22,12,2019,0.00053,0.00014,0.00019,0.00014,0.00018,0.00015,134
Dergrossest,"ABANDONED. While the premise seems fascinating, i.e., a 1001 Arabian Nights-ish tale involving Marco Polo telling Ghengis Khan about all the cities in his vast empire which he will never see, the story is a complete bore. A lot of the cities sound the same (and I understand that maybe all the cities are actually one city - so what?), a lot of the cities simply sound ridiculous (there is a fine line between “fantastic” and “stupid”) and a lot of the descriptions are oddly anachronistic. Maybe it’s the translation, maybe I am not smart enough to see its brilliance or maybe this book just stinks - all I know is that I am not investing any more time finding out.

James Townsend,"This is an interesting, short, and *very* Calvino book. I enjoyed Cosmicomics so, it's no surprise that I found things to like here as well. It's not a 5 star for me because there were just too many vignettes that were like, ponderous and a bit full of it in between the real gems, which felt very bad in a work this short. That said, the gems were veeeery nice. Every Calvino short story collection bears strong markers of his particular sort of romantic, sort of strange way of viewing the world and human desires. This one is no different. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for getting into this author, but certainly worth your time if you already know you're a Calvino fan.",2017-01-30 13:09:46,4,en,2017-01-30 13:09:46,1,2017,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,126

John Wiswell,"Calvino's upstart artists were interested in tearing down the barriers between forms of art, and in Invisible Cities he made a contribution by making prose as beautiful as poetry. Herein are a series of descriptions of cities, each focusing on one aspect (foliage, architecture, a city in the sky, a city underground, etc.). Many of these are no longer than a page, using the beauty of language and potent imagery to create beautiful and meaningful prose.

Invisible Cities is the most accessible Calvino novel I’ve attempted to understand so far.The writing is vivid and unique, the images are so strange and yet so familiar.However, some sections are a bit repetitive, dull, or overwritten so they don’t quite reach the power of their peers. I think that’s inevitable though, because some sections (Valdrada in Cities and Eyes, Sophronia in Thin Cities) are so compelling.

Joe,"I was struck with a thought, when I was around 20 pages or so into Invisible Cities. ""I didn't know you could write a book like this."" I can't say, now, why I should have thought that, of course anyone can write any book any way they want, but there was something so new and simple about the way that this was written that I find myself surprised I've never read anything like it before. The structure of the book, as a series of barely-a-page-long short stories about various fantastical fictional cities, makes it hard to put down. The investment to read about the next city is so low that it kept tempting me to keep reading, but then the gorgeous prose urges you to read more slowly and consider every thing that each city could be a metaphor for. I had to force myself to take it slow and actually contemplate. It's a book I'm certain I'll be reading again, and finding something new in each time I read it.It's framed as a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Kublai Khan, too occupied with running his vast empire to ever see it all, has Marco Polo tell stories of every city he's traveled to, so the emperor can ""possess his empire."" Each story is told like a prose poem, only a few paragraphs long and filled with unbelievable elements or exaggerated imagery. There are cities made only of pipes, or built hanging from a spider-web of ropes between two cliffs. Some cities seem to be filled with the dead or haunted by monsters. Some have airports and ferris wheels and other anachronisms. As Marco Polo tells of more and more cities, Kublai Khan starts to question the veracity of their stories, and eventually he is questioning the reality of their entire conversation. Each city is like a riddle or a metaphor, and they are all varieties on a handful of themes that repeat throughout the book (Cities &amp; Memory, Cities &amp; the Dead, Hidden Cities, etc.). The repeating themes are a really fun aspect, as you can almost feel Calvino working out the same errant thought four or five times, trying to get it right. You could make a fun exercise by taking the cities and re-ordering them, shuffling up the cities and sorting them by category, and I think each one would feel different surrounded by different entries. And the prose is beautiful. Each city is a contemplation on death, or time, or identity, or perception. Each one is so short that it's hard to believe it can accomplish anything, but there's surprising depth in each one.I was really shocked, when I finished, to find Calvino wasn't a mathematician. The structure to the book is so strictly defined and rigorous, but more than that, the concepts explored in both the cities and the conversation evoke a ton of math. Group theory, real analysis, logic, game theory, coding theory, topology, even the philosophy of mathematics. If someone had told me these stories were written to take the more abstract, incomprehensible concepts of higher math, and use metaphor to realize them, I'd have believed it. I absolutely loved this book. Not only will I definitely have to read it again at least once more, I'm hoping to read a lot more from Calvino. This one will stick with me for a bit.Quotes""When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.""""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living.

Nicole,"Odd, intriguing, lyric. Invisible Cities is a book you can read in an afternoon but will leave you thinking about it for a long time afterward. This was my first experience of Calvino, and I'm looking forward to other works on my TBR list. Invisible Cities is set as an anachronistic conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan and explores an incredible range of topics in less than 200 pages.

S Moss,"Invisible Things Are the Only RealitiesEdgar Allan Poe's quote succinctly sums up this novel. However, Calvino uses contemporary writers’ fascination with the limitations and functions of language to show how this occurs: how a sign means something else (and not itself); how a description restricts the totality of the experience; how a person’s experience is limited by previous experiences and bias; whether a form or pattern can be found that expresses an ultimate value or truth; the roles of desire and fear; what silence communicates; et cetera. To be sure, such semantic issues are not most readers’ concern, and many novelists use their semantic knowledge to shape the narrative and novel’s details without specifying any semiotic issues. However, Calvino uses semiotics [The study of meaning-making, the study of sign process (semiosis) and meaningful communication. Semiotics includes the study of signs and sign processes, indication, designation, likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication, Wikipedia] to explicitly shape this book (at least in the early parts). The imagery in the “descriptions” of the invisible cities, as well as the organizing conceit (Marco Polo describes his travels in Kublai Khan’s empire), directly use semiotic processes, in the descriptions creating amorphous, intriguing, mystifying images that appeal to a reader’s imagination and in the narration forcing the reader to confront the distortions and biases involved in narration. Ultimately, the book is about cultural decay and possible stability, how a person, using imagination and logos, may be able to discern a pattern or form in the chaotic images of different cities (which are really signs representing cultural and human issues) and the roles played in this nexus by components of communication.In Marco and Kublai’s first conversation the emperor mourns “that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing. Only in Polo’s accounts is Kublai able to discern…the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing” (3-4). It should be noted that even the basis of this conceit is conceited and shows an Italian bias--the male Western merchant explorer-exploiter has the essential insight into an array of towns with feminine names that compose the Khan’s mighty empire (and toward the end of the book modern cities, future cities and literary creations). Probably one should just accept this as a comic premise for a surreal assemblage that allows Calvino to express his personal feelings, dreams, moods, and ideas about the chaos and decay of modern civilization as seen through the prism of semiotics. For the most part Calvino shows language’s dysfunction by misleading the interpreter, failing to adequately express the essence of objects, or not correlating with a communicator’s intent and desires--major problems especially with verbal components. At the book’s conclusion, the invisible cities remain basically invisible, and the Khan is gripped by melancholy and despair over the future of his decaying empire. Polo warns that this future is already present in “the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.” But not to be completely dispirited, there are ways around this hell: the easy first way is to “accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.” However, the better, risky option is to “demand constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno; then make them endure, give them space” (165).This simplistic, vague explanation how to handle issues of cultural anomie, decay and corruption will hardly be satisfactory for most readers. However, beyond the book’s thin philosophy is the intriguing stimulation given by imaginative descriptions of the invisible cities, whose multitude of details will hint at, but never completely explain or reveal, the city’s essence or form. In a new format, it’s the old allegory of Plato’s cave--the essence of things that determines their form and all its implications cannot be expressed, but Calvino is making his attempt at least to show the problem. The first group of cities focuses on the receiver’s limitations: envy in the first city, then youthful dreams and the confusing variety of desires a person can follow or not follow. Later come stories about the city’s history which also don’t contain its true essence, and in fact the stories become distorted through the telling. Signs may seem to signal the city’s truth, but ultimately the viewer believes the signs and never reaches the truth that the signs might indicate. “There is no language without deceit” (48).Calvino mentions the language components he uses: “words, …isolated nouns, dry verbs, then phrases, ramified and leafy discourses, metaphors and tropes” (38). Elsewhere he notes more complicated linguistic elements, such as the rebus (44) [a representation of words or syllables by pictures of objects or by symbols whose names resemble the intended words or syllables in sound; also : a riddle made up of such pictures or symbols, Merriam-Webster online] and the emblem (22) [an object or the figure of an object symbolizing and suggesting another object or an idea, ibid] and finally logogriph (22) [a word puzzle (such as an anagram), ibid]. These components are poorly understood by the lay reader; in any case, Calvino deploys them in his unique style, which sometimes resembles the structure and content of a fable, or a free-form poem, or the symbology that hints at psychological contexts. For example, desire is said to lead to form which then can either lead to further desire or cancel desire (12, 35); later some cities seem to stimulate male desires, with naked women and various highly sensual images (45-50). This is not even to mention references to underground cities, water supplies that sustain the cities lying above, and a range of other images that evoke male interest in these female cities. While some of the cities’ names are common and probably referential for many average readers, others have more unique contexts, including Penthesilea, the Amazon queen, Theodora, the courtesan-wife of Emperor Justinian, and Berenice, either an Egyptian queen or the daughter of Salome. Certainly male fantasy will be highly stimulated just by mention of these names, thereby accomplishing part of Calvino’s intention, which is for his work to reflect his linguistic ideas rather than any underlying linear narrative or philosophical component, although philosophical speculation about existence enters into the final dialogues of Polo and Khan. In the end the Khan retains the same impression of his empire he had at the beginning: it’s corrupt and decaying, and he still doesn’t know how to resolve this situation or create an ideal city. At most he has been exposed to Polo’s recital of a bewildering array of cities’ examples (or forms) from which he hopes to select parts that could be used for his ideal city. Language (used for discussion and reflection) does not seem capable of helping him find a resolution to his situation. When he first arrived at the Khan’s court, Polo had to communicate by non-verbals, which were imprecise but evocative. As he learned the Khan’s language and the range of language use increased, “the repertory of mute comment tended to become closed, stable” (39) and the imaginative ambiguity of non-verbals (gestures, grunts, vocalizations) with its wider range of meanings was discontinued. One of the main problems with words is that as they become more narrowly descriptive, they limit a broader comprehension of what is being communicated. Soon the Khan objects that Polo’s cities don’t exist, “Why do you amuse yourself with consolatory fables?” (59). Polo explains he knows the empire is sick, but instead of focusing on its ills he’s seeking examples of “the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed” (59). Furthermore, in order for the Emperor to achieve his “unique and final city” (60) Polo is collecting the ashes of the “residue of unhappiness” contained in those cities so the Khan can calculate what his final city must compensate for. However, the next city described isn’t the ideal, prosperous one Polo seems to describe but a “wretched…fly-ridden hole….Falsehood is never in words but in things” (62). Up to this point the problem has been signs and the inadequacy of language, but now that’s compounded by objects that are not what they seem. Such an interest reflects Calvino’s fascination with techniques from fables, which he analyzed in other works. His memo on “Quickness” (Six Memos for the Millennium) emphasizes fables’ compression and laconic word use: “Speed and conciseness of style please us because they present the mind with a rush of ideas that are simultaneous..and set the mind afloat on such an abundance of thoughts or images or spiritual feelings that either it cannot embrace them all…or it has no time to be idle and empty of feelings…The excitement of simultaneous ideas” (42, “Quickness”) is a key technique for this novel and includes the paradox that either the mind can’t “embrace” all thoughts or it has “no time to be idle,” not completely opposite logical points but demonstrative of Calvino’s logical slippages, much as what happens in a fable. The words describing the city of Olivia are not responsible for the city’s duplicity; instead objects are not what they seem, as in a magical story or following the concepts of deconstruction that expose the instability and complexity of objects themselves. The following descriptions of cities focus on the duplicity or multiplicity of the cities’ natures, making it difficult or impossible to decide what might be the real city. Although Calvino doesn’t mention paradox as one of his linguistic devices, it is implicit in many of the cities’ descriptions, starting with Olivia and going through Sophronia with its two half-cities, where the expected city isn’t the one to relocate, or Eutropia, one city made of many that enables people to repeat an endless variety of activities and yet the city remains the same. “Mercury god of the fickle, to whom the city is sacred, worked this ambiguous miracle” (65). The city of Zemrude is inhabited by people full of ill-humor who provide the city’s description, and the “proverbial virtues and equally proverbial faults” of Aglaura where “what was bizarre has become usual, what seemed normal is now an oddity” means “nothing said of Aglaura is true, and yet these accounts create a solid and compact image of a city” (68). Even the person who is trying to describe the city’s uniqueness is inhibited by “everything previously said,” which you are obliged to repeat (68).Then Polo and the Khan discuss their conceptions of a model city, Kublai’s based on a norm while Polo’s consists only of exceptions and contradictions, which he will achieve by “reducing the number of abnormal elements to increase the probability that the city really exists” (69), a fairy-tale solution that defies logic, as does his final caution that he won’t push this too far, as “I would achieve cities too probable to be real” (69). The subsequent cities have elements of lightness: one is suspended by a spider-web, so Octavia is certain it ultimately will fall; the string-city Ersilia has endlessly repeated “webs of intricate relationships seeking a form” (76); and Baucis is on stilts as if the inhabitants have a love-hate relationship with the earth. Leandra has different issues with two sets of gods, one of which claims to represent the city’s soul and the other its form, eternally quarreling about the city’s past and future. On a different note Melania is filled with types from the commedia dell’arte (or even from Roman comedy), which inhabitants rotate through as previous enactors die off, never aware of subtle changes that occur over time. This leads the Khan to ask Polo whether a bridge is supported by the stones. Polo responds that the arch is key to the bridge but without stones there would be no arch. In other words, there cannot be form without substance.At this point Polo says he’s described all the cities he knows, but the Khan says he’s never mentioned Venice. Polo responds “To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice” (86). This moves the narrative to another concern, which is the role played by one’s preconceptions, but Polo paradoxically remarks that “memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased” (87), which is why he never directly mentions Venice, although perhaps his allusions to it in other cities means “I have already lost it, little by little” (87). However, the first city remains implicit, and now cities seem more like Venice, having canals and requiring zigzag routes to get through the city, which is the case for Esmeralda and Phyllis. The zigzag routes of the former mean an inhabitant leads “fixed and calm lives…without any repetition,” and the latter has the problem that an inhabitant stops seeing what’s really in the city following “not what is outside the eyes, but what is within, buried, erased” (91). This is part of the process of a city’s becoming invisible, exemplified even more by Pyrrha, which was imagined as a poetic marvel and when visited was found to be completely different, so that Polo no longer uses its “name that means something entirely different” from what he finally found (93). Such disconnections occur even more starkly in Adelma, where he sees dead ancestors and acquaintances, which he thinks is because at a certain age “the mind refuses to accept more faces…; on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms” (95). Perhaps this means he too is dead, which signifies “the beyond is not happy” (95). Some of Calvino’s more explicit statements are debatable opinions, which, however, reflect the novel’s recurrent tone of melancholy and pessimism because Polo seems to be fruitlessly seeking a replication of his “first city.” This attitude becomes even more explicit in subsequent descriptions, and at this point the tone shifts from fanciful and poetic into a more satiric and history-based reflection. Eudoxia sums up the paradox of whether a city has a fixed fate, which implies a God in control, or whether the city’s confusion, shapelessness and human instability is “the true map of the universe” (97), tying into the Greek and medieval idea of the chain/ladder of being (scala naturae) where human life reflects the cosmic order which is created by and evidence of God. Or perhaps its negative. Polo and the Khan are back to the question of how to find the form of a city (or civilization). Khan accuses Polo of distracting him with “moods, states of grace, elegies” (98) about cities that don’t reveal their form; he wants to look squarely at “the jam of past, present, future that blocks existences calcified in the illusion of movement” (99). They reflect that it’s possible to be present in one place and yet one’s memory is in another, an abstraction from present experiences that allows one to “ponder what we are seeing and living, to draw conclusions, to contemplate from the distance” (104). Perhaps, even more cynically, the Khan’s garden is just an illusion and “all that is left of the world is a wasteland covered with rubbish heaps” (104). This attitude is reflected in the subsequent cities’ descriptions, which have a very different tone. In fact, starting with Moriana, a city that has two sides, one full of transparency and glitter, the observe of soot and decay. Since the city has only “a face and obverse, like a sheet of paper, with a figure on either side, which can neither be separated nor look at each other” (105), which is the “real” city? Next follows the historical record of Clarice, which seems to reflect the history either of Rome or Italy, starting as “an unparalleled model of every splendor, compared to which the city’s present state can only cause more sighs at every fading of the stars” (106). This chapter is an elegy for the “fate” of Rome/Italy with its plagues, invaders, reconstructions using bits of its former glory, immigration of outsiders who had no “connection with the former Clarice” (107), saving “shards of the original splendor” in museums where people could try to reconstruct the original. “Each new Clarice…shows off, like a gem, what remains of the ancient Clarices, fragmentary and dead” (108). Whether the original Clarice existed as a marvel has “no proofs to support it….Only this is known for sure: a given number of objects is shifted within a given space, at times submerged by a quantity of new objects, at times worn out and not replaced; the rule is to shuffle them each time, then try to assemble them. Perhaps Clarice has always been only a confusion of chipped gimcracks, ill-assorted, obsolete” (108).Eusapia exemplifies another negative aspect of this group of cities: it wants “to enjoy life and flee care,” so citizens have made an identical underground city filled with dead people who are set up to enjoy life in only its pleasant contexts, which includes living ones’ fantasies of being royalty or powerful people. But it’s now become clear that “the living have taken to copying its underground copy” or that “actually it was the dead who built the upper Eusapia, in the image of their city,” so now no one knows “who is alive and who is dead” (110). Similarly Beersheba has made copies of itself, one to exemplify its virtues and the other to contain “everything base and unworthy” (111). But the “fecal city” or inferno below is built with expensive materials, and in trying to fill itself Beersheba hasn’t realized that “when it becomes detached from itself, when it lets go, expands” is its only “free and happy action….only when it shits, is [it] not miserly, calculating, greedy” (113). Leonia is overwhelmed by discarded objects because the city is fascinated by everything new, so that “street cleaners are welcomed like angels” (114). As the waste piles higher outside Leonia, similar piles accumulate outside other cities threatening to overwhelm them with their “past, which they had tried in vain to reject” (116).After this satiric, inculpatory group of cities, Polo and the Khan reflect again on which is real: either their garden is only in their minds and people living in toil, work and confusion are real, or the chaos of people does not exist and the garden is real. Or do people exist because Khan and Polo think them? (117). Khan says he doesn’t think of people, Polo says then they don’t exist, Khan says without them they would not be sitting here having this conversation, Polo says then they exist, and we do not. “Kublai: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be. Polo: And here, in fact, we are” (118), as if the writer’s creation has become the reality. One of Calvino’s key issues in this novel is whether logic can be used to “prove” anything, whereas imagination creates reality that doesn’t need to be “proved.” None of the invisible cities can withstand logical analysis, but as imaginary creations they can “exist.” Spending time analyzing them is inappropriate; they are to be enjoyed as imaginary spectacles, inconsistent, improbable, impossible, yet alive in one’s imagination. Which makes the Khan’s efforts to understand his empire equally ill-directed and ultimately fruitless. His final attempt is to see his empire as a chess game; he thinks if he “learned the rules, I shall finally possess my empire” (121). But if, during the game, each state of the chessboard represents a possible form that is immediately destroyed, how can this revea",2018-12-09 06:19:20,4,en,2018-12-09 06:19:20,12,2018,0.00094,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,3284
Aubrey,"2.5/5A lot of writing is the author making shit up and seeing how much the audience is willing to deal with it. Notice I didn't qualify said writing with ""good,"" or ""poor,"" or ""literary,"" or ""genre,"" for as long as tourists take for granted what genocidal capitalism put in place in practically every corner of the globe, there will be the difference between the inevitable solution of the calculus of history and what is dumbed down into a palatable dreamscape for the ""apolitical"" consumer. In other words, once upon a time, I too participated in roleplaying as quite a clever ponce in my review of Calvino's most well known second person perspective composition, committed to a couple more of his works out of sheer peer approved self adulating glee, and then, for one reason or another, never quite got around to them until nine years had passed and everything changed, for good or for ill. Such change means that, with a work such as this, I spent a lot more time thinking about Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire, and what it really meant on a sociocultural level to rule a significant stretch between modern day Korea and Turkey, conquered but only just by such things as the exigencies of time and the Himalayas. So, when Calvino came out with his hundred fanfictions of Venice that were, for the most part, not interested in anything beyond the specific facets of trade, the ubiquity of urban planning as begotten by either settler state expansion or colonial rule, and the erotic availability of the female of the species, part of me had to hold its head in its hands and sigh. The promotion of such common ideological currency certainly made an extremely brief work an even briefer experience, but, surprise surprise. I prefer that my engagement with the classics take on a more involved holistic nature, rather than the satisfaction of completing the latest Wordle.As was the case with Cortázar's Hopscotch, if I hadn't been such an insufferable luddite and barreled on through this piece in an uninspired linear fashion and spent more time digging out the ostentatious narratological structures, I may have spent a lot more time on this (and gotten just as much out of it). Now, it's true that there's some mathematical cleverness involved, and I'm sure I'm missing everything and then some for this being in translation, but considering the historicity this work invokes, you'll have to forgive me for coming to it in search of such, rather than more lists of things. Perhaps this isn't the place for the former, but these days in my search of a ""classic,"" I expect a little more, y'know. Effort in its panache, rather than flashy resting on its laurels. Or at least something that, for all its intellectual artificialities, doesn't indulge in yet another show of the world-weary blasé who confines their scope to five, maybe ten percent of what the world has to offer in terms of culture, creation, and recordkeeping and then bemoans how bored they are with all the inevitable redundancies. In short, if this had felt like an actual dialogue between Genghis Khan and Marco Polo that played off the commonalities of human civilization across the globe without shortchanging the diversities, it would have been rather wonderful. What it ends up coming off as is a Calvino self-insert garnering praises from a figure who could have well been some European religious scion rather than the ruler of the second largest empire known to history. Perhaps these are flaws of Polo's own travelogues, but this work hails from the 20th c., not the 13th, and could have easily benefitted from the much better research into the dialectic between the purported ""East"" and ""West,"" rather than holding up a mirror only to what conforms with one's assumptions and being surprised when one grows weary from having seen it all before.I guess I'm just going to have to acknowledge the fact that reading Neuman's Traveler of the Century has ruined a great deal of that breed known as classic literature of the Europa through my increased expectations of what such writing should be capable of achieving. Thoughts so deeply embedded in the weave and the swerve of history that their realization doesn't decrease the marvel of their evolution, a careful and complete evocation of the rightly accredited old whilst in the mist of building up to the all too necessary new, an immense valuing of the human being without a shortchanging of what human beings can be: so many pieces of writing think they can aspire to the heights of greatness without taking into account one or another or all of these things, and these days, for me, such efforts are insufficient. The highlight of this piece was the inclusion of chess and my subsequent immersion in a heretofore unknown but intensely intriguing history, but everything else was take it or leave it. I still have Calvino's Cosmicomics hanging about, but I don't have much expectation that it will prove anything significantly more than a quick completionist write-off for the sake of a reading challenge on my part. After that, it would be best for the author and I to make our separate ways. Clever is as clever does, but these days, I require that my reads have some meat on their bones, and the more academically adulated the title, the less I give the benefit of the doubt.",2022-03-03 02:54:45,3,en,2022-03-03 02:54:45,3,2022,0.05508,0.00087,0.05711,0.00048,0.00493,0.00074,909

Lee Wenhao,"Incredibly short book on 55 imagined urbanscape but the poweful visual language will require both sides of your brain - logical left and experiential right to collaborate so as to piece all the information together. Italo's book is like none other genres I've come across. It feels fiction yet I've seen some of the cities he mentioned in both real life and in many lucid dreams. The book is dense with information about urbanscape, urban psychology, architecture, sociology, politics, philosophy, history, visual arts and economics. Ultimately, I’d say it fits in the realm of urban studies as well as sociopolitics. Through the eyes of Marco Polo, Italo used 55 imaginary cities to reenact the various façades of Venice. Yet, readers will somehow find these cities apt to describe their home cities too. For example, there was a city where citizens constantly debate about their differences, separating the cities into two dominant groups. The debate will last feom day till night, loud thundering debate in the forum will continue into murmurs if one sticks his ears to one of the neighbiurhood’s doors. I can grasp that the city is being tormented by stark differences yet amazingly tolerant enough to work together in peace. The citizens think they are different. However, they have never realised they are so alike in many ways. This reminds me of Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Another example would be how the citizens of one city constantly discard old stuff to renew itself everyday. Renovation is to be celebrated, old is definitely not gold. Over the years, the city generated so much waste that the wastes have become mountains and the mountains have grown into the world itself, engulfing the city which aspires to be clean and new with old and filth. Hasn't this been familiar to all of us today when we hear news where Hawaii receives worrying amount of rubbish carried by ocean currents from across the globe?There is one city where its citzens are guided by the movements of stars, its marriage, its farming activities and its politics. This reminds me of Babylon from the classical era. All these cities are a testimony to the inherent paradox in today’s cities as well as within each of us. Our desires, our actions, our economics, our architecture, our society - all of which carry a positive note and also a dark side. Italo’s dualistic view of the world gives readers a flavour of Zoroastrianism, yet having an outlook of Daoism while Buddhist in essence. I was somehow anguished and exasperated after finished reading Invisible Cities as I can barely make sense of what I've just read. I know there was a conversation between Marco Polo and Chinggis Khan, there were 55 imaginary cities in total. Yet, to read between lines is a challenge for me. It was incredibly hard for me to conceptualise the cities using both my literal brain and my visual brain. It was an arduous exercise indeed. However, through a reading group, I've managed to train my left brain to translate what my visual brain had experienced into finite sentences. Yet, does this finite sentences capture what my creative brain fully conceptualise? Perhaps not. There, that's the beauty of this book. It looks deceptively simple yet it contains a universe of ideas waiting to be explored. I'd certainly recommend this to any town planners, policy makers and architects.",2018-01-28 13:46:50,5,en,2018-01-28 13:46:50,1,2018,0.00465,0.00011,0.00039,0.00014,0.00036,0.00023,564
Eva,"There are 2 different ways to read Invisible Cities. If you already know this book, jump down to the spoilers.If you don’t know the book, I heavily suggest you just go and pick it up somewhere. All you need to know is that it is about Marco Polo telling the Great Kublai Khan about the cities he claims to have seen. Because I did just that and thus was my initial review:«I read the first story and thought “hummm”.I read the second story and thought “aahh, I get it, this is the book”.And so I fell in love.Invisible Cities is a collection of snippets which read as one might study landscape paintings by a particularly skilled artist. All these intangible experiences, like bottled dreams on display.It’s one of those I encourage reading “by the slices” during stays in liminal spaces. On the metro? Waiting for a plane? Seeking refuge in the washroom? Read a chapter and perhaps no more. Ruminate on it. Cradle the memory of it on the back of your mind, like a smell of incense that won’t abandon your clothes so soon.»Like this I hope you’ve had a chance of travelling through the dreamy Invisible Cities. Now I present you another book, also called Invisible Cities. It looks just the same but is unmistakably different depending on your knowledge.For some it is still just that dreamy book filled with the fantastical cities and tales of an explorer of old. For others it is an exercise in postmodernism, published in 1972, full of symbolism tying to a modern cultural context. I greatly suggest both reads.So, assuming you did finish the dreamy read, find some studies and analysis on this work. Research the writer and the climate during which the book was created. Sitting atop context and background knowledge, the invisible cities show themselves through another lens. However, once the book is put under this light, the reader, touched by it, will find it hard to unsee the modern work within.Muito obrigada à Bárbara e ao Miguel por me emprestarem o livro!And many thanks to a friend over on Tumblr for explaining me how Italo Calvino was part of Italian curriculum.",2019-05-21 23:11:15,5,en,2019-05-21 23:11:15,5,2019,0.00124,0.0001,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,362
Scott Bruton,"One of my favorite things to do in life is to blindly explore a new city, walking the streets alone with a book in one hand and coffee in the other, trying out all of the spots the city has to sit and feel pages flip. It is an extremely romantic and aesthetic experience that runs from you if you run to it, but will walk with you if you are patient and let it catch up. It’s one of those extremely romantic and aesthetic experiences that does not translate well into a date activity. “What are we doing” “Walking down the street” “Okay but what are we going to be doing” “We are going to be walking down the street and intermittently sitting places and feeling them”“….why?” And then you have to spend the rest of the date trying your hardest not to jump into oncoming traffic as the feelings you are looking for get funneled into the black hole of the person beside you. No, when it comes to cities overfilled with people it is best to be alone. Take your dates into lakes hidden deep in the forest or on top of mountains where the aesthetic feelings attack you and you can not get away. In the cities where you have to quietly draw them out amidst endless sounds of traffic, screaming, sirens, and advertisements a they run at the sound of a whisper. But, if you can find me there, if you know what I mean when I say we will be weightless together, pure spirits and only love and appreciation and exploration seeing only beauty and not worried about the rest. Maybe this is the place that Rumi talked about, the field beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing “I’ll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about” Invisible cities feels to me to be an expression about this world that is too full to talk about. It is not an accessible book, and often times that particular descriptor means the book is just a bad book, but this time I experienced in his words the same feelings I feel wandering aimlessly alone through cities seeing things that it seems no one else does, and if they did we could never find the words to talk about it anyway. It would take sideways words jumping adjacently to the invisible cities we see creating an outline by talking around them like in some code where they key is an experience. It will be very embarrassing to me if this book has been thoroughly analyzed and I am speaking nonsense that I’ve invented only in my own mind, but that is the risk of talking at all I suppose. The descriptions of Calvino's fake cities turn to metaphors or prose expositions that unravel into large sweeping truths that exist in every city. The book took work to get into my head but the substance of what it offered me occurred in my heart. I tend to see humanity emphasized in nature by its lack of human influence, but in cities it’s all humanity all the way down.",2022-02-01 10:45:25,4,en,2022-02-01 10:45:25,2,2022,0.00388,0.00012,0.00031,0.00016,0.00031,0.00024,531
Mattea Gernentz,"""Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly. But everything must happen as if by chance"" (140).A brilliant contemplative meditation on desire, cities, and memory. I enjoyed If on a Winter's Night a Traveler more overall for its originality and experimentation with form, but a part of me superiorly loved Invisible Cities for it felt like it had nothing to prove; it was simply a winding journey, city after imaginary city in decadent detail.I meet God most in bookshops these days. On a recent walk, I felt the need to go into my local bookshop, even though I had been the week prior and there isn't much turnover, and Invisible Cities was waiting for me—on display at the end of a shelf, as if misplaced. This text navigates so many ideas I have been sorting through for the past few years. Right after strolling through the city and thinking about my contentment in this space, I opened up to ""He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city... Desires are already memories."" Uplifting! Devastating! Calvino, you've done it again. Calvino, Woolf, and Lispector give me faith in the novel as a form—a vessel for introspection and the encapsulation of human nature, with the freedom to make ""plot"" secondary or absent.""Your labor which gives form to desire takes from desire its form"" (10).",2022-01-07 20:30:50,5,en,2022-01-07 20:30:50,1,2022,0.00097,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,288
50 Cups of Coffee,"As the Venetian traveler Marco Polo described his travels to the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan, my mind followed his travels off of the page. The cities he visited are as fantastical as our imaginations. I involuntarily stopped reading about every other line because my mind was seeing each new city in its strangeness, its absurdity, its playfulness, its horror, its impossibility. I wasn't drifting off or losing interest, mind you. I was just put into such an odd state that Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities created in me a feeling of dreaming. ""Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.""Richard Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype presents a concept that it's not just the physical body that can be regarded as the phenotype, but also the broader effects that result from an individual's genotype. He regularly used the example of a beaver dam. Their genes not only control their physical form, but also the beavers' behavior. Their particular behavior that has a direct influence on their environment is the construction of dams. The dams create ponds, they protect them from predators, and they provide access to food, and, importantly, they modify the ecosystem. Their given phenotypes extend beyond their physical bodies, Dawkins argues, and towards their dams, ponds, their manipulated environments. Perhaps too our cities are our phenotypes. Which is to say, our cities are us.",2020-11-25 03:08:46,0,en,2020-11-25 03:08:46,11,2020,0.00077,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,245
Sarah,"3.5-3.75 I liked this book as a light meditation on what cities mean, but not like a top cat for me hence the 3 star rating. There are some ""mini chapters"" i will find myself going back to specifically the concept of a city being a willed artefact, a human construct but at the same time they are neither fully controlled by humans nor purely by chance. They are bigger than the sum of their parts which is what makes the fascinating but hard to analyse. Cities are a mirror to values of a society and skylines tell you a lot about a city although citizens of that city tend not to feel too attached to their skylines but to their more immediate surroundings. Geographies we tend to find as ""natural development"" do not really exist. The creation of maps is not as neutral and scientific as one would think, Paris changing from having densely packed ""quartiers"" to the arrondissements was an attempt by Napoleon to have political control. Basically take nothing for granted in a city! These discussions are too often neglected especially by societies that largely live in cities now. I mostly picked up this book to compliment my law and social theory course and to help me understand Foucault's concept of heterotopia. I still need more time with Foucault to understand this link well. Overall no regrets!",2020-04-30 21:48:21,3,en,2020-04-30 21:48:21,4,2020,0.00071,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,230
Bárbara Costa,"There are times when you grab a book that you just can't put down because of how good it is. But, if you're lucky, sometimes you might find unexpected little gems that you deliberately take your time to read. Books that are made to be enjoyed each chapter at a time, that awake your imagination and put a dreamy smile on your face when you hold them. (They also make you want to write the cheesiest reviews, where you endlessly gush about it... Sorry mates) :') As you might have guessed, Invisible Cities was the latter for me. Each short chapter was a delightful, surreal and lyrical experience, and it made me look forward to revisit it in the future. This was Einstein's Dreams: City Edition, and for sure my best random purchase this year.

Dario,"Invisible Cities is simultaneously foreign and familiar, magical and real. It is a journey through cities; cities whose names we do not recognise, to be sure, but who, if we are keen-eyed, we may catch a glimpse of in our day-to-day, on our commute, or in our daydreams. These are cities that may lay within your city. Present and absent does not prove to be a relevant dichotomy; everything turns on the eyes - the eyes of the eyes, but also of the skin, nose, and mind. Or else we are invited to further Marco Polo's stories, to addend the novel, to look, sense and write ourselves - for a city is always several. Calvino masterfully explicates and indicates the subtle threads that bind cities; he shows us the cities hidden within cities. For cities have their own logic, quite abstract from that of the syllogism. The logic or reason of the City is often a sort of logic of chaos, or a chaotic principle - no less complex, ordered, multi-faceted and profound than that of the stars.",2020-09-09 03:40:35,0,en,2020-09-09 03:40:35,9,2020,0.00073,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,177
Lourdes,"The thing I like best about this book is that Calvino's descriptions are just far enough out of the ordinary to be ""strange,"" yet weirdly plausible. Even though I'm reading a translation, I can tell he is a master of words.Invisible Cities is constructed as a series of imaginary travel anecdotes told to the emperor Kublai Khan by Marco Polo. Fifty-five prose pieces each describe a different fabulous city and each contains a conceptual or philosophical puzzle or enigma. It delves into the themes of memory and perception, civilization and the expansion of the modern world, along with the consequent overcrowding that has persisted to the present.Calvino is an absolute bibliophile so there's reference after reference to classic literature. Within Invisible Cities, he makes direct references to Thomas More's Utopia and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as well as to other philosophical works that critique modern consumer culture and criticize modern dependence on images to mediate experiences.",2022-10-18 19:52:23,4,en,2022-10-18 19:52:23,10,2022,0.00069,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,157
Sabrina,"the perfect read for my move across the country: the two takeaways that stick with me the most are 1) how your impression of cities will always be retroactive because they are formed through experience of new and different cities and 2) that your experience and communication of a city says so much more about you than the city, because the city in your mind will always be inevitably distinct from the actual physical manifestation of the space I got to reflect and appreciate the places i have lived and found comfort in the opportunity to now experience and learn someplace new especially when it feels scary to. Such a unique collection that I believe is most fully enjoyed when saved for transitional times in life — specifically big moves and will stand multiple re-visits.

Susi Lopera,"Calvino is able to achieve an intangible lushness, charm and beauty in his writing. His writing feels haunting and otherworldly, for it doesn’t operate in the realm of the everyday. The world of the book isn’t the physical mundane world we inhabit. It’s a shimmering ethereal of world of words, poetry and possibilities. Even when Calvino describes tangible architecture, his descriptions feels fantastical and unbound by laws of physics. The world of this book is very beautiful and engaging for the imagination. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the cities of the dead, in particular Adelma. However, a few days after reading the book, I have forgotten basically every description. The book is rich and vivid, but without story or solid characters to anchor it, the writing shimmers out of existence like a mirage.

Akreid,"This is a book that lends itself well to traveling with and which, as the first work of Calvino I've read, I'll need to read again. Invisible Cities amounts to a sum greater than its parts, like Kublai Khan's own atlas of the world, the index of fictional cities Polo describes is mere outline for something hidden and greater. Each city might stand on its own, as a kind of prose poem or myth. Not every piece contributes equally and I wondered what certain pieces contribute. If there is an order to the cities I'm missing it. Themes rustle through Cities, like winds of chance. Memory, desire, movement, and a subtle tale of a modern empire, vast and unrecountable.

Cassidy,"4.5 - Calvino’s descriptions are soooo atmospheric and beautiful and for that alone this is worth a read. I loved the format as well - the short snippets of conversations between the Khan and Marco Polo gave me both definable stopping points as well as a sense of theme in what would otherwise be seemingly incongruous and nonsensical city descriptions. This book reminds me a bit of “An Elemental Thing” which I read some months ago, but it has the continuity and theme that I thought was lacking from it.My favorite cities below:-Maurilia -Euphemia-Zobeide-Armilla (the final lines of this one keep playing on repeat in my head: “In any case, now they seem content, these maidens: in the morning you hear them singing” chefs kiss bellissimo bellissimo)-Clarice-Irene-Thekla -Raissa",2023-01-05 05:26:24,4,en,2023-01-05 05:26:24,1,2023,0.00068,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,128

Only after reading it, it became enjoyable, which is a bit weird. The things it allow you to think about and interpret for yourself is very cool, and makes for a very different experience. And this wouldn't work in any other book, but the short length and Italo Calvino's unique style makes the little trick work. The cities are descriptive and fun to imagine, but in the end it's extremely open what they might mean. Sometimes a little too open. Overall it's a good book.

Alfredo,"For some reason, Calvino's cities all carry female names. Perhaps because they are desired, feared, loved. Some are fickle, many exotic, all ethereal.No, they are not women. They are iterative manifestations of one same noumenon: life. A life that replicates itself: underground, in the sky, inside and outside itself, before and after itself. Conversations between the Great Khan and Marco Polo are but meditations on imagination as what enables us humans to deal with life.Invisible Cities is a treatise on literature and life.

More than likely nothing approaching what the author intended either. But I don't care. Marco Polo describes the cities he has visited to Kublai Khan: fantastic, impossible, ethereal spaces.

Marcus Pacenza,"Italo Calvino has become my favorite author, and this is my favorite book of his. In Calvino's other books, I felt that the absurdity of his writing style, although brilliant, got in the way of the plot. Invisible Cities deals with this problem by simply not having a plot. Instead, it's a collection of incredibly short stories describing mystical cities, interspersed by dialogue between a fictionalized Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. This format allows Calvino to explore a wide variety of topics, from suburbia to consumerism to love to religion, without getting hung up on any of them.

Troy Schwab,"A great read that I would easily recommend to others. Conceptually, the whole thing is terribly clever; using cities as an allegory for life and the human condition, magical sur/realism injected into it, and framed as stories told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, just nail on the head great idea for a book and excellent execution from Calvino. Great form blending prose and poetry.All the cities, flicking through, I see are lovely. I think having a list of favorite cities is appropriate over quotes for this collection, but trying to make a list of my favorites is too difficult (too long a list), and any particularly good quotes require more context than can be provided in a brief excerpt.A good book for re reads.",2022-08-29 11:42:27,4,en,2022-08-29 11:42:27,8,2022,0.00054,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,125

Chris,"In my late teens or early twenties I imbibed the notion of ‘holiday consciousness’ from something I’d read, I’m not sure what but it may have been from Colin Wilson’s The Occult, published in 1971. The concept I understood to be this: we become so familiar with personal rituals in the everyday places we inhabit that we become not only a bit jaded but in fact almost sleepwalk our way through existence. Holiday consciousness however involves the trick of seeing the familiar as though visiting it for the first time, as a tourist. After this I took to travelling regular bus journeys and walking daily routes pretending I was not in my home town but in a different city, perhaps in a different country. I noticed new things that I hadn’t before: architectural details, pedestrian behaviours, the quality of light, a different awareness of spaces. It was like being on holiday while staying in one place, and awoke my tired senses and heightened my perception without the need of artificial stimulants or expending money on overseas travel. I was reminded of this holiday consciousness when recently reading Calvino’s Invisible Cities. The author postulates a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in 14th-century China. Polo’s trips through the domains of the Khan culminate in reports to the emperor, initially prompted by objects from the cities Polo has supposedly visited but later, as the Venetian starts to master the language, by direct speech. Each city has a name such as Eudoxia or Octavia, quite obviously a woman’s name, and each of the fifty-five conurbations described has a peculiarity that differentiates it from all of the others. One is surrounded by water, another has a vast hinterland; another still has a hidden subterranean counterpart while a further one is distinguished by the views at roof level. This concept of gaining knowledge about the general from the particular, whether from an object or a reported aspect of the city, is quite clearly inadequate to usefully convey the totality of each city, as soon becomes clear: as Marco’s cities proliferate Kublai Khan begins to suspect that only one city is being described and that is Venezia, La Serenissima, the City of Bridges or Queen of the Adriatic. This moment of realization (if the cover blurb has not already given it away) creates the consciousness that Jorge Luis Borges often produces in his short stories, where, aided by the catalyst of magic realism, normal consciousness metamorphoses into that awareness of the Fantastic that we encounter on holiday . Calvino compounds this feeling of disorientation by introducing into Polo’s accounts of his medieval cities anachronistic details that are only possible in the twentieth century. He further subverts matters by reversing the usual model of the master-disciple dialogue drawn from Ancient Greek examples: who, in these conversations between emperor and visitor is the one to whom deference is due as the teacher? Is it the mighty Khan or the lowly Polo? And, just as doubt has been expressed that the historic Marco Polo actually journeyed to the Far East, with his tales perhaps ghost-written by a fellow prisoner when he returned to Italy, so we soon stop suspending our belief in the conceit of these fictional descriptions and conversations being historically plausible. Instead, we start to understand the narrative as a series of meditations for us moderns to ponder on: if Venice can be described in more than fifty ways and one still not get to its essence, how much less so can we comprehend other cities, states, peoples or persons in a brief instant? The descriptions of the cities are relatively short, a page or two at most, and have been rightly described as prose poems. I really enjoyed Calvino’s collection Italian Folktales and the individual ‘tales’ in Invisible Cities captured much of the same tone and purpose. There is much else to consider in this novella, such as the elaborate structure that Calvino founds his narrative on, or the ability of any translation, even this excellent one by William Weaver, to adequately convey the subtleties of the author’s language without copious notes and a working knowledge of Italian; these are matters to perhaps contemplate more fully after further readings. For now, this observation: I followed Invisible Cities by reading another of Donna Leon’s thoughtful Commissario Brunetti crime novels. These are set in a Venice which is not the tourist’s destination but which is nevertheless a bona fide city with ordinary and extraordinary inhabitants and where goodness and wrongdoing intermingle. It is a city largely invisible to the visitor on holiday even if all too obvious to Venetians themselves, and as such is eminently suitable for inclusion in Marco Polo’s wondrous catalogue, Calvino’s modern classic.http://calmgrove.wordpress.com/2012/1...",2012-12-25 21:56:48,4,en,2012-12-25 21:56:48,12,2012,0.00086,0.00012,0.0002,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,789

Aaron Arnold,"Early in Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, he describes a moment when some of the characters walk near a cathedral and are able to hear ""its bells ringing changes, mostly just tuneless sequences of notes, but sometimes a pretty melody would tumble out, like an unexpected gem from the permutations of the I Ching"". Similarly, in this collection of descriptions of imaginary cities, sometimes each metropolitan litany produced an arresting simile or piece of imagery, and sometimes they were just a few paragraphs of ""literary"" writing that made next to no impression at all on me. I don't want to be contrarian, but is this book really so highly-regarded based merely on the neat sentences Calvino sometimes comes up with? It can't be the philosophical ideas, because those are either somewhat boring, or unoriginal, or both.For an example of boring, in ""Cities &amp; Eyes 1"", Marco Polo is telling Kublai Khan about the city of Valdrada on the shores of a lake, where ""the traveler, arriving, sees two cities: one erect above the lake, and the other reflected, upside down. Nothing exists or happens in the one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat, because the city was so constructed that its every point would be reflected in its mirror.... The twin cities are not equal, because nothing that exists or happens in Valdrada is symmetrical: every face and gesture is answered, from the mirror, by a face and gesture inverted, point by point. The two Valdradas live for each other, their eyes interlocked; but there is no love between them."" If I were writing a paper on this book in a freshman English class, I would say that the story ""was an exploration of the concept of duality"" or something like that, but it isn't: the whole description of the city is barely a few hundred words, and does nothing other than describe a city and its watery doppelgänger. Similarly, for an example of unoriginality, at the beginning of chapter 7 there is an exchange between Polo and the Khan about the difficulty of telling the difference between dreams and reality:""Kublai: Perhaps this dialogue of ours is taking place between two beggars nicknamed Kublai Khan and Marco Polo; as they shift through a rubbish heap, piling up rusted flotsam, scraps of cloth, wastepaper, while drunk on the few sips of bad wine, they see all the treasure of the East shine around them.Polo: Perhaps all that is left of the world is wasteland covered in rubbish heaps, and the hanging garden of the Great Khan's palace. It is our eyelids that separate them, but we cannot know which is inside and which is outside.""It's like Calvino is expecting his audience to have never heard of Zhuang Zi's dream of the butterfly, or any of the zillion other manifestations of this idea.Even the central conceit of the book, that Polo is describing the city of Venice by describing its opposites or metaphors for it, doesn't feel like it needs a whole book to describe it, even one as thin as this. Not that it isn't a pleasant read, with excellent descriptions and use of language and so forth, but I simply had no reaction to most of it. Exceptions include ""Cities &amp; Desire 3"", which vividly describes how different a city can look depending on how you arrive; ""Cities &amp; Names 4"", about the cyclic nature of urban life; ""Cities &amp; the Dead 3"", with its vivid vital necropolis; and a few others, but for me most of the pleasure lay in the combinations of words Calvino found (and how translator William Weaver interpreted them), and not really in any of the concepts. I make an exception for the conversation between Polo and Khan at the end of chapter 7, which hilariously sounds exactly like two people having a bad drug experience.""Kublai: To me this conjecture does not seem to suit our purposes. Without them we could never remain here swaying, cocooned in our hammocks.Polo: Then the hypothesis must be rejected. So the other hypothesis is true: they exist and we do not.Kublai: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be.Polo: And here, in fact, we are.""Whoa dude, far out!Ever read that Borges short story ""The Lottery in Babylon""?

João Vaz,"Short little book that documents the exchanges between an old emperor and a traveller, who had been commissioned to travel across the empire, garner information about the places he had visited, and report back to the emperor. The book consists of multiple two-to-three paragraph descriptions of each city and is interspersed with a conversation between the two. Cities are imagined and act as a meditation on time, culture, and our human experience. Particularly liked the city of Leonia, which offers a discussion about environmental concerns; a city that is continuously expanding, as its citizens throw waste onto a pile of refuse that grows past the boundaries of the city. Or Laudomia, a city split into three: the city of the living, the city of the dead, and the city of the unborn; and that invites a reflection about the meaning of life, as we, the living, seek explanations about the present either from those that preceded us or from future generations, as we toil to leave something for our children. The book, although small, is very dense. Every paragraph, line, and word, is packed with meaning. A poem in prose. I must say that this wasn’t a pleasurable read, perhaps because of the state of mind that I read it in. I was looking for something less loaded. But it’s objectively an incredible literary achievement. I dogeared some pages for future reference. There are some unforgettable passages, or at least passages that I hope not to forget. Definitely a book that I want to re-read at a time when I feel more contemplative. I’ll surely revise my rating then.",2021-10-03 18:53:06,3,en,2021-10-03 18:53:06,10,2021,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,269

Dimitris Hall,"Zenobia, the city on stilts. Vitoriana first told me about this book and sung its praise by describing the mental picture of this city in particular.Invisible Cities is another of those difficult-to-review books I've been going through lately, although perhaps ""trudging through"" would be a more accurate description. Another one enjoyed in audiobook format, too, and another one I couldn't concentrate on and retain as well as I would have liked. I have walking, running, wandering through wheat fields, traversing rocky capes and enjoying less-or-more-than-imaginary landscapes in Samothraki to blame. Or it could just be my complete inability to focus on three things at a time---in this case my ears, my visible eyes, and my inner eye. It does sound just a bit too much, now that I mention it.What I can say is that Invisible Cities turned out to be a very interesting idea of a book---or is it a book of an idea? Marco Polo visits Mongol leader, tells him of his travels to incredible cities far and wide---most of them named curiously similar to ancient-sounding Greek and Latin female names, some rather common in Greece even today---and proceeds to have deep discussion with the Mongol leader (sounds a bit oxymoronic as I'm writing it) on the nature of language, experience, travelling, story-telling... the general business of empire-ruling and noblesse.Those invisible cities of Marco's all have some distinctive fantastical characteristic: one's buildings have no walls, the pipelines defining the cityscape; Zenobia, pictured above, is built on stilts (like Venice, just without the water---Venice, as Marco Polo's hometown, also plays a rather central role in this book, perhaps as the archetypical invisible city bar none, just as big a mystery to Kublai Khan as the rest of this book architectural and cultural urban menagerie); another still is a meeting place for merchants who trade stories instead of wares. One city is special in that all visitors remember it perfectly just by visiting it once, while another is its visitor's memories of it. And so it goes.Invisible Cities is highly structured yet defies usual narrative conventions; it is abstract, exploring imaginary realities through the kind of what-ifs I've most often found in science fiction, yet it does so by looking at human history and existence as a whole, rather than at just its future. Calvino's language is descriptive while being poetic and profound, inviting the reader's inner eye to see the Invisible. In all honesty, the vibe I got from this book is that of a geometry-twisting, meta philosophical indie video game in the vain of Fez or The Stanley Parable.Would Italo Calvino have been a genius game developer had he been a millennial?Invisible Cities is just one of these books that stands out just from how different and unique it is and how ahead of its time I perceive it today to have been. Or maybe it wasn't ahead of its time at all: we've just internalised precious little about the intellectual zeitgeist of the '60s and '70s and the early days of radical postmodernism in literature. Could it be that instead of them being ahead of their time, it's us who are lagging behind and have progressed less than we think we have, perceiving our intellectual maturity as greater than it actually is?",2012-10-18 01:59:15,4,en,2012-10-18 01:59:15,10,2012,0.0009,0.00012,0.0002,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,545
PreciousMist,"Good lord. Where do I start?This entire book feels like I'm reading a teenagers first venture into Actual Writing after they ironed out the kinks in their grammar and got a hold of their thesaurus, and listened, too literally, to the ""Show, don't tell"" advice.This is the worst book I have ever read. I mean that. I also understand why it's such a classic. I can understand the message, the influences, the intentions behind it. I can also understand that it's boring as hell. What I cannot understand how such a short book, read in less than five hours total felt like fifteen, uninterrupted, hours.I liked the cities that refered to the dead. Simply because I wish that was me. Also because the author didn't use a ""big brain"" take on his own self created symbology, and at hour three of reading this book I didn't have to jump through hoops to understand a single sentence. If goodreads allowed me to give it zero stars, I would. But it can't and I did like one (1), single thing, so the one star feels appropriate. Actually I liked two, those cities and finally hitting that last page and throwing my book across the room, but I don't think the last one is part of the reading experience- and I would detest giving this book two, undeserving stars, if it was.",2022-02-10 00:31:00,1,en,2022-02-10 00:31:00,2,2022,0.00788,0.00013,0.00066,0.00015,0.00045,0.00025,229

Дмитрий Филоненко,"Marco Polo, a Venetian trader, tells Kublai Khan about mysterious cities which he has traveled through in his numerous journeys. The whole book consists of short stories about cities, intermingled with meditative dialogs between the trader and the ruler.Well, of course it's not about cities although each story starts with picturesque and fairy description of high towers, and columns made from some exotic material, and mysterious but inviting streets. Each story is a metaphor. And this fact connects this book to either old sacral texts or poetry. You can read just one story a day or a month and ponder, and meditate. Some of them are about us, our society: inequality, our attitude to the nature, our busyness with daily routine and inability to see a bright side of the world around. While others are very deep, and sometimes paradoxical.A feeling of weirdness stemming from the fact that you are not the one who you used to be or that you don't possess something anymore, is awaiting for you in unfamiliar places, where you will never possess anything.What do you feel when you see someone and realize that maybe in another life you could have been that person? A feeling that you only then stop being a stranger in a city and start perceiving it when you have lived there an entire life. Which makes existence of others - people and cities - desperately unperceivable.A man exiled from this present or from imaginary past.Or a moment when you start endowing surrounding people with the faces of those from your past, faces of dead. Isn't it a point of an utmost turn in a human being?There are many of such deep and overwhelming discoveries in this book. ... And cities. They are beautiful and mysterious. Strip them from all hidden philosophical and psychological layers, and they are still marvelous. Each of them could be a scene of some unknown novel written by Borges or Marquez. I can imagine a few of them painted by Dali or Escher.

Meghan,"There are far better and more eloquent reviews of this out there. So I will only say that occasionally once or twice a year, I stumble across a story that touches me to my core. It resonants with everything that appeals to me about reading. It is difficult to describe this book: part architecture, part love letter to Venice, part fantasy, part introspection of self. But what makes it so good to me is that I found myself in so many of these cities. As a traveler, I could relate both to Polo's descriptions of cities that change the moment you enter them, of cities that are duplicates of cities you been to before, of cities that can only be seen from afar and those only seen from within. As an expat, I appreciated his story about Phyllis (cities and eyes 4). The newness of Beijing--""'Happy the man who has Phyllis before his eyes each day and who never ceases seeing the things it contains,' you cry, with regret at having to leave the city when you can barely graze it with your glance."" versus becoming a resident: ""Soon the city fades before your eyes....Like all of Phyllis's inhabitants, you follow zigzag lines from one street to another, you distinguish the patches of sunlight from the patches of shade, a bench where you can put down your basket....All the rest of the city is invisible.""I cannot properly express how this book made me feel other than if poetry were like this book, I would be the world's biggest poetry fan. Plus, as Venice is my favorite Italian city, Calvino painted this city with words like Guardi or Canaletto. It was vivid and alive and brought all my favorite memories rushing back.The surprising part of this book is how much it reminded me of Indian writers, like Salman Rushdie. There was an almost magical/mystical aura with his words and phrasing.I don't think this would suit everyone's tastes, but if you enjoy traveling or architecture, I think you may be pleasantly surprised by this tiny story.",2013-08-29 19:08:51,5,en,2013-08-29 19:08:51,8,2013,0.00086,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,344
Eleanor,"Re-read this in 2014. I need to re-review this just to state that this may be my all-time favorite book. My desert island book. Each ""city"" is a confection spun from the simplest whim. What if a city was like an hourglass? Or a ribbon in the air? Or there was a city that lived on the other side of a puddle or mirror? What if a city was inferred only based upon peoples' trash, or the things muttered while asleep or the places they left behind? Each idea is so poetically human and the format of neatly encapsulating each idea into a ""city"" to demonstrate the trueness of something by means of whimsy and a brief flight of imagination is just...delicious. Wherever people are is a hive of possibility in relationships and the resulting tenor of a town. Exploring this idea, albeit in poetic and fantastic fiction, is a delightful way of looking at cities in general, especially for those who crave them. In Calvino's time cities were even more fief-like, adding to the potency of each ""place"". It's frequently said that throughout the entire book Marco Polo is only talking about the same city, Venice. A perfectly pleasing interpretation. But here's mine: each city is given a woman's name because Marco Polo is actually just talking about women he's known by ""translating"" the experience of the relationship into a city. I loved reading the book that way.The last handful of stories along with Polo's final advice to Kublai Khan give me so many chills. I used to wonder about people who re-read books every year. Not any more.Found this brief essay by translator William Weaver on working with Calvino, a nice supplement for anyone else who needs help coming down from such great heights as this book offers: http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/ca...",2008-06-13 20:43:29,5,en,2008-06-13 20:43:29,6,2008,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,301
Adam,"I had expected Invisible Cities to be abstruse and require some careful thought to pick out its ideas. On the contrary, it wears them on its sleeve. Invisible Cities is in many ways like a Bible for post-modernism. Each of these micro-stories is like a tiny parable expositing a pomo idea, often in the most simple, stripped-down fashion possible, using cities full of medieval travelogue exotica as examples. Calvino is especially fixated on the differences between things-in-themselves and our concepts of them (riffing on Plato more than Kant, perhaps) and the myriad senses in which our concepts of the world are social constructs rather than realities (in one city, people tie different colored strings between their houses to embody social and familial relationships). The concepts are simple and straightforwardly explained, which is of course not the norm for European post-modern philosophy. It certainly didn't scratch my itch for a deeper discussion of the concepts I generally hold as my world-view, but some good choir-preaching is always fun. Calvino has spare, beautiful prose and a lot of creative ideas. However, the book stretches its conceptual material a bit thin by the end; the stories often seem to repeat nearly the same points in different ways. The meandering repetition suits the style and I'm not sure the book needed to be any shorter – it's easily a half day read – but it is certainly a flaw. Calvino readily invites comparison to Borges, which is just always going to reflect badly on any work, and more than anything reading Invisible Cities made me wish I was reading Borges. That comparison makes my point: Borges' stories never suffer from a paucity of philosophical premises.",2010-02-19 00:20:12,4,en,2010-02-19 00:20:12,2,2010,0.00386,0.00013,0.00064,0.00014,0.00033,0.00019,281
Gaetano Venezia,"""I speak and speak,"" Marco [Polo] says [to Kublai Khan], ""but the listener retains only the words he is expecting.

It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""…""And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, ""Darling, let me dip into it,"" to a young serving-maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at having painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow in the illumination of that page in the volume where the philosopher says: ""Also in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy cit contains a happy city unaware of its own existence""",2014-12-14 10:28:03,4,en,2014-12-14 10:28:03,12,2014,0.00089,0.00011,0.00017,0.00011,0.0002,0.00015,320
Kathy,"?????William Faulkner's 1932 Light in August gave us this brain-twister about the delicate process that awares us to truth: Memory believes before knowing remembers. Believes longer than recollects, longer than knowing even wonders. Once upon a time I heard a high schooler repeating this to himself, trying so hard to figure out what the heck ol Bill meant that it glued itself to my own brain and I spent the next ten years thinking about it.Italo Calvino's 1972 Invisible Cities gave me soliloquies on ~memory~ and ~desire~ and whatever the heck a thin city or a continuous city is but mostly just awful, interminable boredom. The difference is Faulkner's ramblings make delicious sense. I am convinced that Invisible Cities, on the other hand, was written by injecting random adjectives and nouns between a general grammar for paragraphs on end and, what's worse, gaslighting people into believing it experimental genius. You could tear out entire pages and the next reader would never know it. Or switch them around at will and, again, none would be the wiser. In fact you could read it backwards and it'd be the same book. Yes, one could throw this book at a wall and read just the section it opened to and effectively have read it all with less headache and maybe even some appreciation.

Kamalendu Nath,"Marco Polo “…Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”“I have neither desires nor fears,” the Khan declared, “and my dreams are composed either by my mind or by chance.” (pg. 44 – paper edition)Such interludes of conversations between Marco Polo from west at the Kublai Khan’s court appears at the beginning and end of each of the 9 sections of this book. Except for the first and last section there are 5 chapters that are numbered in reverse order (5,4,3,2,1). I presume that is to impress upon the incongruous ideas presented in this book on cities and its residents. The whole purpose seems to undefine all norms and explore diverse realities. It serves well in inducing confusion and elaborate ideas which are in conflict with itself.It is akin to modern arts or modern poems to me, to appreciate which I must be educated or take college courses. Otherwise, the gospel and the non-gospel of the narrations in this book is in par with extreme asylum-residents under inappropriate medication. I read the whole book wondering why and how I did so for it’s neither a novel nor a book of wisdom. It’s vignette of tautological arguments exploring all deeper meanings, that one can cook up, that may underlie the human habitations know as cities.

Ashish Kumar,"Warning : don’t you dare assume me as a dumb person who doesn’t understand the beauty of true and intelligent literature. Now, I feel like if i criticize this book, I will be upsetting lots of people and they will definitely think me as a total wash-out and stupid and illiterate. Well for your information I’m none of the above. As that been said, I didn’t particularly enjoy this book. Invisible cities, in short, is about Marco Polo describing different imagined cities ( and they are 55 ) in one or two paragraphs to Kublai Khan. That’s all. So. when I began reading it, I thought, oh its so intelligent and beautiful and so poetic and descriptive and no doubt, it is all those things but as I was more than half way through it, I felt this heaviness of boredom over my head. Polo / Calvino describes cities with one very specific ideas attach to them and he delivers them very immaculately and beautifully. His language and choice of words are adroitly perfect. But lets face it, how long can you read the description of one city after another after another. There are total 55 cities he describes and I can only remember handful of them. The descriptions are so short and so little time spend that its impossible to really understand them before he throws a new city with a new ideas. Then there came a point where they all seems repetitive and monotonous. I did enjoy in the beginning of it because it was fresh, unique and also there was this touch of magical realism in it.

Nancy,"""Travelers return from the city of Zirma with distinct memories: a blind black man shouting in the crowd, a lunatic teetering on a skyscraper's cornice, a girl walking with a puma on a leash.""At its most basic level, Italo Calvino's novel is a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, as the former describes the fantastical cities and landscapes he's visited during his explorations. Of course, this is severely understating the scope of Calvino's book, which at times feels like a novel, at times like a travelogue about a voyage to mysterious and imaginary places, and at times like a series of puzzles. A constellation of intensely lyrical descriptions, it presents itself as an atlas, a map of the world where history and geography become mental spaces; all reality is thought. There's something pleasantly disorienting about this book. Whenever I'm reading it (which I have to admit is quite often), I see the world a bit differently, at an angle. Even though it's quite short, it's not the kind you devour in one sitting. Not because Calvino's writing is difficult to penetrate, but simply because he packs so much into each sentence. There is so much there there. It's best, I think, to read Invisible Cities like a traveler — slowly, luxuriously, as if you have all the time in the world.There are no linear plots, clear morals, or social realism but if you love hypothesis, mannerism, conundrum and fantasy then this is the book for you.",2016-07-08 09:30:16,5,en,2016-07-08 09:30:16,7,2016,0.00099,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00018,247
J. Dorner,"The book includes Marco Polo's descriptions to Kublai Khan of faraway places (though it's unclear if these parts are fictional, true, or fiction-based-on-truth). It's poetic, heart-warming, and soul moving. There is more to be felt in these short, simple descriptions of settings than many authors convey or achieve with entire novels. I urge any writer struggling with settings to study this book. The philosophy included in these pages is on par with Socrates. Modern descriptions are woven in with the ancient ones. The underground trains of Zirma are mentioned, when trains did not exist until 500 years after Marco Polo. That is the first clue that this book means to transcend time, to travel back and forth through it without regard. Sophronia has a rollercoaster, carousel, Ferris wheel, motorcycles, and factories — all of which were, obviously, never encountered by Marco Polo. Leonia, a city with refrigerators, radio, toothpaste, and light bulbs— is a city that sounds like the whole of America.

Crito,"I maybe should write this later, I'm transfixed by Invisible Cities at this moment. It has that effect on you. You live the floating abstract reality it bathes you in. The prose is hypnotic and not unlike that of a white eyed oracle. The both defining aspect of this novel and its greatest strength is it does not hit you with a grand profundity. Instead it lays out dots of truth, allegory, lesson, experience, perception, knowledge, an archipelago of small fragments and ideas dotting out an outline of what may be the grand profundity of which takes a different shape each time. Foreign concepts are familiarized, and familiar concepts are turned and made foreign looking. This kind of talk sounds like dumb non-description and sauntering around the meat of it but the truth is you have to play by this novel's rules; its ambiguity and abstraction and also its grounded truths do not let go of you. ""Marco Polo tells Genghis Khan of his travels"" is the more poor description here. I plowed through this one and I really wish I hadn't, you're meant to stay and enjoy the imagination at play here. This novel is the vision and originality that makes literature so great. I'm sure I'll have a better description by my fifth reread.",2014-12-05 14:16:02,5,en,2014-12-05 14:16:02,12,2014,0.00302,9e-05,0.00026,0.00013,0.00028,0.00019,216
Simon Robs,"Piecemeal, in bites, a ""city"" here which excites the mind's eye, and several others each with their own grand themes and many with inverse/obverse peculiarities, combinations and colorfully imagined all but, in toto what's what that Calvino is cooking here? The stage dialogue that guides while dividing the city descriptions carried on by Marco Polo and Kublai Khan is itself interesting as it's always interesting to imagine an ongoing conversation by two prominent men in history who might plausibly have had much to say to one another, but even here it increasingly evaporates into a metaphysical deconstruction of said cities and more towards a nihilistic dream though wonderful in all the glitzy detail. Calvino struts his stuff albeit it's simple mesmerism between two covers, for me. It just seems that every so many book reads and something on my well constructed to-read pile underwhelms - isn't that what personal taste or timing or, I'm sick whilst reading thus may have affected my ability to connect? Not sure so no sweat it won't detract me from trying something else of his or maybe even give another read down the road.

Ioana,"‘Invisible Cities’ was a beautiful book, but it failed to give me a narrative that I could follow along and a better mapping of what’s going on. If you are someone who appreciates descriptions and choice of words, evocative kind of prose, and don’t need a complimentary story, you will love it.Marco Polo tells Kablai Khan all about the different travels he’s taken, the cities he’s seen, their architecture, cultures, behaviours of the locals. There’s little stories about people he’s encountered and how people there interact. You have explanations of their geography and their importance in history.The book is somewhat structured as a story within a story but the interactions between the Khan and Polo are minimal. There’s no plot as such. And I guess that’s the difficulty I had. I liked the story telling a lot, but ultimately it didn’t go anywhere, I felt like I was going in circles, a bit like reading an imaginary travel guide. And because there were so many places, each given a few paragraphs, none of them really stayed with me, I forgot what each of them were, what they were called, what made them special.If you like Italo Corvino this is definitely very him - original, innovative, and really drilling into a particular topic.",2021-10-01 18:49:52,3,en,2021-10-01 18:49:52,10,2021,0.00061,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,212
Yana,"This was another piece I just finished reading by Italo Calvino that was written in 1972. How I wish I liked this book even a little bit! But sadly I am not a part of that niche group of pretentious people that enjoyed this painfully slow book.Invisible Cities is about a traveler named Marco Polo who discusses his countless journeys to different cities with an emperor named Kublai Khan. He basically goes into HEAVY detail about each city and how terribly great they were or how mysteriously terrible they were. I don’t really have much to say about this book except for the fact that I did not enjoy it as much as I was hoping to. I liked Mr. Palomar which is a different book also written by Calvino but the writing in this one it just felt like there was NO POINT. The plot was just not executed the way I wanted it to be and it got old very fast. I practically skimmed through all the descriptive language that I usually don’t mind. But holy cow this thing was so slow it felt like being run over by a large snail. It felt like I didn’t understand the entire point of the story and just kept on reading just to finish the book. However, I can admit he does use very beautiful imagery and some of the descriptions for the cities I mean WOW! But I wouldn’t read this book again, like, ever.",2022-01-03 01:33:59,2,en,2022-01-03 01:33:59,1,2022,0.001,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00014,246
James,"I had heard so much about this book that i started reading it with great anticipation and then slogged through every one of the pages. It is hard to pin point down what this book is about, at the most simple level Marco Polo is describing the cities he visited to Kublai Khan but obviously the description of each city contains layer upon layer of meaning. I personally feel that the book was a bit like those 3-d pictures you only see once you let your eyes go squiggly and then it becomes abundantly clear that what was once a series of hopeless dots is actually a polar bear having a coke. I alternated between declaring the emperor had no clothes to berating myself for not having the brains to fully enjoy this book. I have come to the following conclusion you had best read the book when your in your early 20s and really want to impress someone with how smart you are and have the energy to debate each cryptic allusion. Alternatively you can wait until you're in your 60s and wise with a life's experiences you can plow through the book appreciating the elegiac tone while drinking lots of red wine. I am almost looking forward to it. Could have been five stars or 1 star.",2010-04-27 15:57:05,3,en,2010-04-27 15:57:05,4,2010,0.00341,9e-05,0.00028,0.00012,0.00034,0.00018,219
Noah,"Invisible Cities is a novel which defies its classifications: rather than a proper novel, it is a collection of vignettes, images of seemingly dissimilar cities. And then again: these are not only images of dissimilar cities, but of cities which, in their anagogical resemblances, represent man and all his creations as well as Creation and all its men. Accordingly there is no plot but recognition, and yet there is also no aimlessness; the question and answer remain in the final page, the final city, as they exist within the first dialogue, within the first city. In comparing civilization to the uncivilized, the void and the heavens, the hidden to the seen, man is demonstrated as equally indistinguishable. He is the city's creator and destroyer, just as it likewise is to him. It falls entirely on the shoulders of man to identify himself and the city, to make out the human from the inhuman, and, in doing so, to choose between acceptance and resistance of those ever-present flames of inferno.",2014-09-08 06:10:39,4,en,2014-09-08 06:10:39,9,2014,0.00131,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.0002,0.00018,169
Wendy,"I thought this would be an interesting read paired with The Travels of Marco Polo and...yes, yes it was. The real Marco Polo (as far as we know), based on his prose, comes across as organized, detail-oriented, but doesn't reveal a tendency for poetic language or license. In fact, he takes great pains to de-mythologize tall tales, and is careful to attribute any hearsay with ""I didn't see this, but I heard from so-and-so"" followed by ""sounds fishy, but that's the story they fed me.""Calvino's Marco Polo is the complete opposite. He is a poetic device that ties together a litany of vivid, metafictional essays about fictional cities, or perhaps caricatures of real cities, or fifty-odd versions of Venice, or something. I really don't have any idea, and I'm sure I'm not meant to, either. Whatever this is, it is hypnotic, and soothing, but I couldn't focus on it for more than a few pages at a time. Like poetry or whiskey, it's best sampled in tiny sips.",2015-05-13 08:13:44,3,en,2015-05-13 08:13:44,5,2015,0.00061,0.00013,0.0002,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,168
Anmol,"“The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.

My reading of Invisible Cities was very contradictory. I read some of the most beautiful passages ever in the conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, and read many uninteresting descriptions upon descriptions of fictional cities in between.

Charles Dee Mitchell,"An aging Kublai Khan asks his emissaries to bring him reports of the cities scattered across his vast empire, an empire he senses is crumbling. His favorite interlocutor is the young Venetian Marco Polo. Marco is a Scheherazade of travel reportage. Night after night he creates for the great emperor descriptions of cities each more fantastic, more impossible that than the one before. He speaks them into being.This is a remarkable piece of writing, but I prefer two different Calvinos. There is the Calvino who wrote the early science fiction stories of Qfwqf, a space traveler who like Marco Polo is an intrepid explorer of other worlds. There is also the Calvino who translated Italian folktales and created his own wonder tales with The Baron in the Trees and The Cloven Viscount. With Invisible Cities Calvino creates exquisite dreamlike portraits of his locales, but for me the book comes most alive in its depiction of the young Venetian’s relationship with the aging emperor.",2014-04-30 03:54:28,3,en,2014-04-30 03:54:28,4,2014,0.00071,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,163
Amalia,"The puppet master called Calvino has a blueprint. He takes Khubilai Khan and Marco Polo aside and puts them in a constant dialogue about places which can be found in Khubilai's empire.

You can feel overwhelmed in the turmoil of descriptions but then it turns up that it's all spiralling down to the description of Venice.""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.

Shelley,"If books were workouts for mind, this one is sure gonna help build some muscle in just 150 pages! There's something magical and dreamy about it. These imaginary cities are all around us, atleast in bits and pieces. Each chapter takes the mind to far off places and yet they hit closer to home than your neighbour's house. Cities have a life of their own and men travel around to seek answers to their own questions. Sometimes cities give them the answers and sometimes cities ask them questions about desires and fears. But in most cases, the experience of the traveller is unique like an art piece being interpretated differently by the onlookers. Only the artist knows what he intended to make, cities feel a bit disturbed by the limited meaning traveller takes with him and propagates it across the world like a river of ideas. The traveller rarely sees the confluence of rivers into the sea of a grand scheme which governs every desire or fear.",2021-01-09 13:54:56,5,en,2021-01-09 13:54:56,1,2021,0.00107,0.0001,0.00017,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,167
Paloma,"The cities in Invisible Cities are chronicled as if in a dream by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan: lands he has supposedly seen on his travels described in wild miniature ethnographies (and sometimes, obtuse Gnostic-sounding parables). Each is impossible, fantastical, irrational, paradoxical; hopeful or horrifying. They’re about the psyche of a city’s inhabitants, playing with the boundaries of self, language, perception, and/or reality. Many of the cities’ names happen to be women’s names, and accordingly, many of the chapters about cities work equally well as complex descriptions of relationships with individual people.It’s a short book, but DENSE, so you’ve got to digest each city on its own the way you would take tiny bites of extremely decadent food.

A collection of impressions and descriptions meaningless on their own but made meaningful by your own experiences living in cities and amongst your fellow man and traveling to unfamiliar places. Calvino's most iconic line: that when he travels, all he sees is Venice, all the traveler sees in these great cities is pieces of home, also applies to the text and the act of reading it.

And every few chapters, there is a similarly brief chapter of exchange between Polo and Khan. Thus on the surface this is primarily a descriptive book with not any real plot, character development etc. But halfway during the book, the exchange between Khan and Polo become rather philosophical and they make some poigant observations. At times I felt Polo wasn't describing a city but rather hidden crevices of a great mind. It didn't make it to a 5-star level for me because I just didn't feel emotionally drawn into it very much.",2007-05-10 14:13:12,4,en,2007-05-10 14:13:12,5,2007,0.00056,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,123
Mark,"Another of those books where I had not realized the impact it had on me until I dove in once more with the benefit of hindsight. Read for the first time somewhere around the age of 19, I remember enjoying this collection of vignettes, framed as Marco Polo describing the cities of empire to Kublai Khan, while the Khan tries to find an order or pattern to his empire. The cities themselves are fascinating, and end up containing quite a bit of musing on utopian thought. So, yes, the way I look at cities, the way I look at how we give a city personality, both that perceived by residents and that seen by visitors, the soul of place, a lot of it came from this book, and I somehow had not realized it.

Kes,"What makes a city? Is it a matter of perspective? Of the relationships between its denizens? The gods it worships? The way it treats its dead? The way it looks at life?This is a book full of short vignettes about imaginary cities. The descriptions are beautiful:In vain, great-hearted Kublai, shall I attempt to describe Zaira, city of high bastions. I could tell you how many steps make up the streets rising like stairways, and the degree of the arcades’ curves, and what kind of zinc scales cover the roofs; but I already know this would be the same as telling you nothing. The city does not consist of this, but of relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its past: the height of a lamppost and the distance from the ground of a hanged usurper’s swaying feet; the line strung from the lamppost to the railing opposite and the festoons that decorate the course of the queen’s nuptial procession; the height of that railing and the leap of the adulterer who climbed over it at dawn; the tilt of a guttering and a cat’s progress along it as he slips into the same window; the firing range of a gunboat which has suddenly appeared beyond the cape and the bomb that destroys the guttering; the rips in the fish net and the three old men seated on the dock mending nets and telling each other for the hundredth time the story of the gunboat of the usurper, who some say was the queen’s illegitimate son, abandoned in his swaddling clothes there on the dock.And I love it when he talks about how sometimes it's a matter of perspective. Take Raissa:And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, ""Darling, let me dip into it,"" to a young serving maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at having painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow in the illumination of that page in the volume where the philosopher says: ""Also in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.""And Isaura:Isaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over a deep, subterranean lake. On all sides, wherever the inhabitants dig long vertical holes in the ground, they succeed in drawing up water, as far as the city extends, and no father. Its green border repeats the dark outline of the buried lake; an invisible landscape conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight is driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock's calcareous sky. Consequently, two forms of religion exist in Isaura. The city's gods, according to some people, live in the depths, in the black lake that feeds the underground streams. According to others, the gods live in the buckets that rise, suspended from a cable, as they appear over the edge of the wells, in the revolving pulleys, in the windlasses of the norias, in the pump handles, in the blades of the windmills that draw the water up from the drillings, in the trestles that support the twisting probes, in the reservoirs perched on stilts over the roofs, in the slender arches of the aqueducts, in all the columns of water, the vertical pipes, the plungers, the drains, all the way up to the weathercocks that surmount the airy scaffoldings of Isaura, a city that moves entirely upward.There are imaginary conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan that weave the narrative together - and they are lovely.Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.“Journeys to relive your past?” was the Khan’s question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: “Journeys to recover your future?”And Marco’s answer was: “Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveller recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”And:And Polo answers, ""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name.""It's a beautiful travel book; full of the little ideas that bloom lightly in your mind's eye.",2018-09-07 18:09:14,4,en,2018-09-07 18:09:14,9,2018,0.00203,0.0001,0.00021,0.0001,0.00024,0.00017,975
Phil,"What a fascinating gem of a book this is. Calvino's books are always based around paradox, symbols, signs, where meaning begins and ends, if language is reality or if there is any reality at all or just infinite separate discrete experiences.Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of dozens of cities, where 1001 Nights meets the A to Z, but these aren't cities you can visit: they're dream cities, cities of paradox, cities of impossibilities, cities of fable, cities seen from the corner of the eye in a dark room when half asleep. And at heart, in some tiny detail, every single one of these cities is Venice.Calvino is a unique writer.

Sunil,This book is a metaphysical journey in the form of a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo discussing the various attributes and perspectives of human civilizations with imagined cities as their flagships.It reaffirmed my view that most original and handsome literature in English has came from continental Europe( Russia inclusive) and from languages other than English.

Rachel,"I was overly aware of how difficult rating 'Invisible Cities' would be throughout reading it. While there were parts that really struck me, they tended to be odd lines or turns of phrase, only rarely full 'cities'; I felt I spent most of the book waiting for a breakthrough or at least to be moved out of my sustained sense of '...and?'

Addie,"I have been meditating on this book for some time, both during my time reading it and now after, as I have finally finished. I've taken my time with this one, spending several months exploring it, despite the fact that it is a mere 165 pages. But each of those pages is so much more than just a small vignette, or a small metaphor. Each page takes a lot of consideration, and since I recognized that this book was different - special - from the very beginning, I decided to give it my full attention, to give each page my full consideration.Although the thoughts I have on this book and the full experience of reading it are extensive, I will try to keep this review brief, despite the fact that Invisible Cities not only deserves but demands the highest level of reflection and inspection.The book is formatted as a series of short tales. Each chapter is short, some being only a paragraph or two, and most barely going beyond 2 pages at most. The overall premise of the book is that Marco Polo is telling an aging Kublai Khan of his adventures as an explorer, and is describing to the Khan all of the cities in his vast empire.However, as the book unfolds, it becomes clear that Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are not exactly true or historical characters, but rather vessels for a conversation that is truly happening between Italo Calvino and the reader. At first, the cities that Polo describes are all mythic and ancient, exactly what the reader expects from such a poetic book. But soon the cities begin to reflect more and more our own modern realities. And that is when we discover that it is not just the past that is being described in this book, but the present and the future as well.This book is much more than a description of cities done in beautiful, lyrical language. This book is a representation of the human condition, of society, community, family, grief, desire, and memory. But these elements do not exist as you might think they do. They are not show through imagery or dialogue or plot — they are shown through architecture, through the physical nature of a city, or of many cities. And Calvino is the architect of these cities, showing their truths through the way their streets are constructed, the way their confines are shaped, the way that their inhabitants perceive their signs, signals, and appearances.This book is full of beautiful metaphors and gorgeous sentences. Reading it completely sparked my creative self, and gave me an urge to write and create in the way that Calvino was, with such poeticness and wisdom. So much of this book feels melancholic—not all of its cities are sad or damaged, but there is an air of solemnity, wistfulness, and bittersweetness that permeates every page. I don't recall many cities that represented as pure joy, although there were strains of happiness throughout the book. But as the book goes on, the sadness begins to morph into something more intense. Calvino, and his companions, Polo and the Khan, weave the seemingly unrelated cities into one interconnected metaphor—and one interconnected warning.At first, the book shows you small signs, small concerns, disturbing and unsettling things below a surface of beauty: ""I entered Hypatia one morning, a magnolia garden was reflected in blue lagoons, I walked among the hedges, sure I would discover young and beautiful ladies bathing; but at the bottom of the water, crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks, their hair green with seaweed.""Soon, the signs grow larger, less isolated, turning into a greater theme: ""The Great Khan contemplates an empire covered with cities that weigh upon the earth and upon mankind, crammed with wealth and traffic, overladen with ornaments and offices, complicated with mechanisms and hierarchies, swollen, tense, ponderous. The empire is being crushed by its own weight.""This concern is threaded throughout the rest of the story, especially in the chapters marked as continuous cities, where each city Polo thinks he has discovered turns out to be a monotonous continuation of only one great monopoly of a city.Calvino contemplates what I interpreted to be the horrors of overpopulation and extreme capitalism, of sheep stuffed into a tiny pen, entirely without freedom, politely accepting their lot in life. There is also no doubt that he is disturbed by the destruction of the natural world: ""At last, with an extreme massacre, the murderous, versatile ingenuity of mankind defeated the overweening life-force of the enemy. The city, great cemetery of the animal kingdom, was closed, aseptic, over the final buried corpses with their last fleas and their last germs. Man had finally reestablished the order of the world which he himself upset: no other living species existed to cast any doubts.""In the end, this book is a lot of things. It is both a love letter to and a critique of humanity, of our cities and our traditions and our perception of the world. It is also a warning of the future that awaits us should we not stall the exponential spread of the continuous city and make room for something more. Calvino does not attempt to tell us what that ""something more"" is. Invisible Cities is one great cycle of questions and answers, and true to its form, it ends on an answer that can only inspire the reader to ask the next question.",2021-01-01 01:19:48,5,en,2021-01-01 01:19:48,1,2021,0.00063,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,912
KC Smelser,"I picked this up two days into a vacation in Venice last week, and I could not have found a better book for my travels. I read this slowly during meals and while sitting and admiring the city, and found much to dig into. It is short, and something of a light read, but beautiful and challenging at the same time. Ostensibly about Venice, this novel is really philosophical prose poems that explore the human condition in cities, using Venice as a spring board: how cities take on personalities of their own that they derive from their inhabitants, and how this leads to ideas and concepts about cities that then affects and shapes the inhabitants of those cities in the present and future. Venice could very well be a perfect example of this - throughout its very long history it has been shaped in various ways by the people living there: a place to flee from mainland violence, the last hold-out of the Roman empire, a place with no need for defensive walls, a place with liquid streets. An idea of Venice made by Venetians and non-Venetians formed, and those ideas have further shaped the city and those that live there in an endless cycle that has resulted in a place that is very different from any other place in the world: “ It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.” There was much more to this book as well - explorations of consciousness, identity, and how memories and descriptions, stories and details can enrich and destroy each other in shifting patterns. Polo's descriptions of Venice in different forms are a way to hold on to the memory of his home city, but at the same time these tales alter his memories: “Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased.” The dialogues between Khan and Polo were also fascinating: At this point Kublai Khan interrupted him or imagined interrupting him, or Marco Polo imagined himself interrupted, with a question such as: “You advance always with your head turned back?” or “Is what you see always behind you?” or rather, “Does your journey take place only in the past?”All this so that Marco Polo could explain or imagine explaining or be imagined explaining or succeed finally in explaining to himself that what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveller’s past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which each day that goes by adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveller finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.“Journeys to relive your past?” was the Khan’s question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: “Journeys to recover your future?”And Marco’s answer was: “Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveller recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.” All in all, this little gem made wonder and question more than many books twice its size. Here is one final quote that I found to be intensely beautiful: “And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, ""Darling, let me dip into it,"" to a young servant-maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at having painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow in the illumination of that page in the volume where the philosopher says: ""Also in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.”",2017-06-01 23:28:58,5,en,2017-06-01 23:28:58,6,2017,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,946
Helen  Luo,"Audaciously innovative, Calvino's 'Invisible Cities' is a harbinger to its more stylistically accomplished successor in 'If On a Winter's Night a Traveler'. The story centers a conversation in a palace patio between an aging Kublai Khan, the Mongolian founder of the Yuan Dynasty and grandson to Genghis, and Marco Polo, the young venetian explorer. Marco Polo rouses the Khan's imaginative spirit by regaling him with descriptions of various cities he's journeyed to - but as the conversation unravels, his exploits seem increasingly fictitious as the cities appear to converge into a single city, or a city of the mind, or perhaps no city at all, and perhaps neither Marco Polo nor Kublai Khan are there either. Reminiscent of other dialogues like 'The Debates of King Milinda,' the playfully untethered dynamics between the Khan and the explorer reveal the early threads of the postmodernist signature that defines Calvino's literary legacy. Yet, literary restraints and criticisms can be rightly levied against postmodernist metafictions, even when their basic narrative logic is to defy standard literary norms. While 'Invisible Cities' is generally immersive as a travelogue to places that do not exist, that defy time and space - some of the metaphysical juxtapositions go overboard into the land of repetitive, gimmicky pastiches (take for example Fedora, the city of globes where citizens come to the glass orb at the center to behold the reflections of their desires - except perhaps the city inside the globe's reflection is the real city all along?). And perhaps this is the translator's burden, but 'Invisible Cities' is at times extravagantly reckless with language (""there is no language without deceit"" - City and Signs 4) that the individual sentences, so burdened with layers upon layers of wordplay and conceptual metaphors, lose their conventional meaning altogether. There is also a sense of distance and foreignness - while the cities are described in their way of life, the inhabitant's customs, the flowers native to the area and such, very little of the descriptions focus on intimate details and exchanges between identifiable characters. In this sense, it pales in comparison to a less ambitious novella - ""Einstein's Dreams"" by Alan Lightman, a gentle speculative fiction where the laws of physics are manipulated as a means to bring the spotlight onto the human and the mundane - a child sitting by his ailing uncle's window in a world where cause is not connected to effect, a woman dodging floating buildings in a gravity-less world so she can reunite with her lover. 'Invisible Cities' has no interest in these passions and intimacies. This is not to say that Calvino's soft, brilliant hand isn't still palpable throughout. We can see this in the choice to feature Kublai Khan as the interlocuter (why not Genghis Khan?) - Kublai who is pictured as slow, sedentary, his days of conquest long gone and in his old age, relinquishing his desire to conquer new lands. Kublai's willingness and eagerness to entertain cities that cannot possibly exist, which contain train stations and factory workers and skyscrapers, which he cannot even conceptualize, with no desire to possess them, is moving in an odd and indescribable way. A great number of the metaphysical jousts also surprised me - particularly the passage which flirts with the possibility that Kublai Khan and Marco Polo in this story, much like the cities they are collectively imagining, do not exist - ""Perhaps this dialogue of ours is taking place between two beggars nicknamed Kublai Khan and Marco Polo; as they sift through a rubbish heap, while drunk on the few sips of bad wine..."". And when it is revealed that perhaps our interlocuters do not share a common language such that Marco Polo must gesticulate, point at objects like hourglasses and dried peppers, mimic and mime, to narrate his journeys, the reader becomes powerfully aware of the imaginative act as an act of creation, and the fact that we can never return to the dream worlds we created. My favourite theme here, however, is indubitably in its nostalgic longing for one's own homeland with a heart hardened by travel, in the passage when the Khan asks why Marco Polo had yet to describe his birthland, and Polo simply replies ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.""4.5/5 Elegiac and metaphysically innovative",2022-07-19 10:14:08,5,en,2022-07-19 10:14:08,7,2022,0.00109,0.00011,0.0002,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,719
Todd Stockslager,"Review title: Philosophical fictionFrom History.com: ""Upon reaching China, Marco Polo entered the court of powerful Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, who dispatched him on trips to help administer the realm."" So Calvino is imagining conversations between men who may have had conversations like these. Or perhaps, no one has ever had conversations like these, as Marco Polo describes cities of the Great Khan's realm in fantastic, philosophical and impossible terms. This is philosophical fiction unlike any novel I have ever read. In the course of the book, Marco Polo and his sponsor have nine sessions, beginning and ending with a brief conversation between the two men; while Calvin provides no descriptive narrative, each speaks in the character of their culture and personality, Kublai Kahn the conquerer and leader of an empire speaking in magisterial terms, Marco Polo the sharp-eyed European traveler and Renaissance man. After their introductory dialogue, Polo then describes a set of cities, 10 cities each in the first and last session, and five in each of the seven in the middle, covering 55 cities in their nine sessions. While Marco Polo names each city in his description, Calvin titles the descriptions not by the city's name but by a characteristic, for example ""Hidden Cities"", ""Cities and Desire"", and ""Cities and the Dead"". Marco Polo describes five cities for each of 11 different characteristics, but not sequentially. If my attempt to describe the layout of the book sounds confusing, reading the content is too--until you slow down and really read it. With only 165 pages in the small format paperback edition I read, and lots of white space, Invisible Cities can easily be read straight through in a couple of hours. Most of the cities are described in one or two pages, some only one paragraph long. But the content and the format encourage and reward contemplation. First, pay attention to the framing dialogue between the two men. It is important. By their fourth session, Kublai Kahn has heard enough and thinks he understands enough, and turns on Marco Polo and accuses him of lying: ""Your cities do not exist. Perhaps they have never existed."" (p. 59) Kahn is beginning to realize at the same time we the readers do that Calvin's Polo is more philosopher than travel guide. And next, pay attention to the depth and poignancy of the philosophy/descriptions that Polo gives to the cities he had seen, or imagined. They may in fact be invisible cities, as cities and dreams can be invisible (p. 43-44): ""Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears."" He describes a city that consists of two halves, one a carnival midway, the other permanent--but it is the ""permanent"" part that gets dismantled and moved! (p. 63) Another city is suspended on a net over an abyss where life is ""less uncertain than in other cities. They know the net will last only so long."" (p. 75) dreams, desires, permanence, persistence, are these in fact lies, imaginations, or philosophies? And finally, pay attention to the symbols and meaning in the conversations and descriptions. Pursuing the definition of meaning diminishes the power of symbolism (p. 39). ""Signs form a language, but not the one you think you know."" (p. 48) Concludes Polo, ""There is no language without deceit."" These thoughts are just a few of the ones I encountered that made me stop, reread, and think about the depth of the ideas behind the prosaic. Perhaps my favorite, and the where I will conclude to leave others for each reader to discover on their own: Marco Polo describes the stones that build an arch that support the bridge. When Kublai Khan asks him which stone supports the bridge, Polo replies that no stone does, only the arch. Then Khan demands: ""Why do you speak to me of the stones? it is only the arch that matters to me. "" Polo responds simply: ""Without stones there is no arch."" (p. 82) This is not your genre fiction or philosophy textbook, indeed this is unlike anything else you are likely to read this or any other year. It is intense and calm, funny and poignant, unique and classic.",2022-07-19 07:47:59,5,en,2022-07-19 07:47:59,7,2022,0.00068,0.00012,0.00018,0.00011,0.00017,0.00015,694
H. Dalloway,"People seldom talk about a book as a science fiction entity. I don’t mean of course the story inside the book, but the semiotics, semantics, the different signs that communicate that story. As wheels and cogs in some kind of cognitive time machine.But when we speak about Italo Calvino we have to talk about it. Because a Calvino story is always more science fiction in the way it is written, then the story itself. Not so much what it says, but how it says it. Often when we say that a book took our breath away, made us forget time, transported us to some other time, we talk about the story and what the story was about. A brave new world gave us a glimpse of the future and Utopia threw us back to a strange and funny alternative reality. But in Italo Calvino’s Invisible cities and in many of his other books there is more going on. Calvino was a member of the Oulipo group. It was founded in 1960 and consisted of writers and mathematicians. They used what they called constrained writhing techniques, different mathematical structures, patterns and palindromes. Story-making machines. And how cool is that!In Invisible cities Calvino “or his story machine” describes 55 different impossible and at the same time plausible cities. Every second or third page a new city is explained in the most beautiful and intriguing way. But even though every city is unmistakably different, three underlying variants reappear. Firstly an invisible city inside the visible city, secondly a mirrored city of the visible city and thirdly a city that is either contracting or expanding in some way. Pretty soon all these cities starts to get mixed up, become interchangeable, fall into one another. Become one and the same. And I guess there are many possibilities to what this “machine” is doing. Maybe what it tries to describe through the cities is humanity itself. People with their invisible souls, mirroring each other. A living organism breathing, expanding in its birth and youth and contracting in sorrow, old age and death. Show our true nature. And by doing so creating an opportunity to change something within us.Because now it feels like something is different. Rearranged, moved, replaced, altered and tightened. Because I followed the narrative of the invisible cities, impossible cities and yet plausible. I have to acknowledge the fact that something plausible and yet impossible has happened inside of me of which I know nothing about. Only that it has probably happened.So when you walk up to your bookshelf, take out a book, see the front cover, spine and back cover. Be careful. Feel that certain amount of weight. Caress it and take in its scent as you flip through the pages. Open it, look inside, and between the empty spaces you will find a story. A science fiction story perhaps. But if it’s a Calvino story, beware! Because there is probably some other mathematical reason to that story. And who knows what that entails.",2020-05-05 01:41:11,5,en,2020-05-05 01:41:11,5,2020,0.00081,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,501
Ayon Ibrahim,"The story-telling is very dream-like and surreal and that's great. However, I feel like the theme does get a little overdone at some points. Some of the city descriptions end up sounding quite similar to each other - which is probably part of the point, I know, but it does make reading the book a biiiit more tedious. However, it is overall very much worth a read - some of the cities are truly imaginative, like Octavia, the spider-web city hanging over an abyss, and Adelma, a city whose inhabitants bear the faces of those long dead. It also presents some fascinating, through-provoking ideas/musings about cities (and life), both within the recounting of the cities and the philosophical discussions between Polo and Khan. I've highlighted a few of my favorites below:Octavia, the spider-web city, the 5th city in the 'Thin Cities' theme.""Suspended over the abyss, the life of Octavia's inhabitants is less uncertain than in other cities. They know the net will last only so long.""Intro to section 3:""Cities also believe they are the work of the mind or of chance, but neither the one nor the other suffices to hold up their walls. You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.""Outro to section 4:""...I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced. It contains everything corresponding to the norm period since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations.”Phyllis, 4th city in the 'Cities and Eyes' theme. Marco speaks of being dazzled by this city (or really, any other) as a visitor, and then making a permanent residence there.""Soon the city fades before your eyes, the rose windows are expunged, the statues on the corbels, the domes. Like all of Phyllis’s inhabitants, you follow zigzag lines from one street to another, you distinguish patches of sunlight from the patches of shade, a door here, a stairway there, a bench where you can put down your basket, a hole where your foot stumbles if you're not careful. All the rest of the city is invisible.Outro to section 5:""Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. “But which is the stone that supports the bridge?” Kublai Khan asks. “The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,” Marco answers, “but by the line of the arch that they form.”Kublai Khan remained silent, reflecting. Then he adds: “why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.”Polo answers: “Without stones there is no arch.”",2021-09-08 11:04:37,4,en,2021-09-08 11:04:37,9,2021,0.00102,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,451

Tristan,"This was arguably a novel, I suppose.In all seriousness, Invisible Citites pushes on the boundary of what a novel is and not just in the way that ""maybe Wuthering Heights or Mrs. Dalloway could be read as a poem as well as as a novel--focusing on these structural and stylistic elements that fit the aesthetic/generic category of prose poetry"" but as in it actually violates some basic assumptions about narrative. Invisible Cities is a novel about people talking and about travel. The book takes the form of a series of brief descriptions of imagined cities, no more than two or three pages at the longest, placed between a series of brief scenes between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan discussing the cities, the process of the telling, whether or not the cities exist, whether or not they themselves exist, etc. Each city is headed with a description, things like ""Cities and Memory,"" ""Cities and Eyes"", ""Hidden Cities"", ""Thin Cities"", ""Continuous Cities"", which highlight the sorts of things that each city meditates upon. The individual cities are beautiful and fascinating--the city that leaves behind string replicas of the relationships that filled it, the city that is only a series of signs, cities that are inside of each other, cities of the dead, cities that are everywhere and no where. Together, Invisible Cities is a fragmentary reflection of the possibilities of humanity--what we can produce, what rests inside of what we do, how we may interact--filled with a beautiful and hopeful melancholy. Many of these cities are sad, but many are joyous and as in ""Hidden Cities 2"", ""the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence"" and so even the bleakest cities have a germ of hope and even the happiest cities are aware of their imperfection and transience.Structurally, the novel really takes advantage of emergence. Each string of identically titled cities forms (I thought) a coherent point, but they are all scattered throughout the novel, forcing us to try to connect the cities that are next to one another as well as the ones that discuss the same ideas. Memory and desire become linked, dead, the cosmos, and continuity become related. The novel builds on these emergent meanings to produce a feeling of totality and fullness, a sense of all that the novel is trying to get at being tied together in the world. It becomes a meditation on meaning-making, one that does not flinch from the reality of life's difficulties, but that has immense faith in our ability to form meaning out of whatever we have.Stylistically, the novel is fluid and elliptical and easy to simply drown in:Thus when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of the abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spider-webs of intricate relationships seeking a formEvery city has this sort of magical feeling, and the frame tale shares it, using the veil of romance history has placed on the two characters to make this catalog of cities ever more plausible without losing its connection to the fantastical.

Josh,"""A vegetable vendor was weighing a cabbage on a scales and put it in a basket dangling on a string a girl lowered from a balcony. The girl was identical with one in my village who had gone mad for love and killed herself. The vegetable vendor raised her face: she was my grandmother. I thought: ""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.""The stevedores climbed the steps in a line, bent beneath demijohns and barrels; their faces were hidden by sackcloth hoods; ""Now they will straighten up and I will recognize them,"" I thought, with impatience and fear. But I could not take my eyes off them; if I turned my gaze just a little toward thecrowd that crammed those narrow streets, I was assailed by unexpected faces, reappearing from far away, staring at me as if demanding recognition, as if to recognize me, as if they had already recognized me. Perhaps, for each of them, I also resembled someone who was dead. I had barely arrived at Adelma and I was already one of them, I had gone over to their side, absorbed in that kaleidoscope of eyes, wrinkles, grimaces. 95 I thought: ""Perhaps Adelma is the city where you arrive dying and where each finds again the people he has known. This means I, too, am dead."" And I also thought: ""This means the beyond is not happy.""---But first, for many long years, it was uncertain whether or not the final victory would not go to thelast species left to fight man's possession of the city: the rats. From each generation of rodents that the people managed to exterminate, the few surviviors gave birth to a tougher progeny, invulnerable to traps and resistant to all poison. In the space of a few weeks, the sewers of Theodora were repopulated with hordes of spreading rats. At last, with an extreme massacre, the murderous, versatile ingenuity of mankind defeated the overweening life-force of the enemy. The city, great cemetery of the animal kingdom, was closed, aseptic, over the final buried corpses with 159 their last Beas and their last germs. Man had finally reestablished the order of the world which he hadhimself upset: no other living species existed to cast any doubts. To recall what had been fauna, Theodora's library would preserve on its shelves the volumes of Buffon and Linnaeus. At least that is what Theodora's inhabitants believed, far from imagining that a forgotten fauna was stirring from its lethargy. Relegated for long eras to remote hiding places, ever since it had been deposed by the system of nonextinct species, the other fauna was coming back to the light from the library's basements where the incunabula were kept; it was leaping from the capitals and drainpipes, perching at the sleepers' bedside. Sphinxes, griffons, chimeras, dragons, hircocervi, harpies, hydras, unicorns, basilisks were resuming possession of their city.",2021-12-03 08:18:46,0,en,2021-12-03 08:18:46,12,2021,0.01785,0.00019,0.00155,0.00035,0.00132,0.00058,518
Eitakbackwards,"This was a short little change of scene from the last book and what a treat it was! It's a piece of experiemental fiction involving two historical figures: 1) Marco Polo telling 2) the fifth emperor of the Mongol Empire, Kublai Khan of his travels through the empire, describing each city that he has visited.This book was a banger. It's quite dream-like, and really evokes the kind of distant memories we all have of the pulse of a new city. The indiscernable treatment of time helps create that feeling. There are 55 fictitious cities, each visited briefly in the same vein as Marco Polo's actual travel memoirs: 'The Travels of Marco Polo'. But Calvino's cities somehow aren't fictitious, there are elements of each that are so familiar. Calvino was part of the 1960's movement of writers, Oulipo. Oulipo promotes the use of mathematical constraints to construct literature. 'Invisible Cities' has 9 chapters, each introduced and concluded by a dialogue between the characters, each section dealing with a theme. If you plot these variables against each other in a table you get 'a symmetric pattern with respect to rotation around the center', the city of Baucis (quote from wikipedia). There seemed to be allusion to this form in the text itself and the repeated mention of concentric structure of some cities.It's a really philosophical book, packed FULL of observations and ideas not just about what elements make a city but also of time, death, culture, environmentalism, religion, politics. The communist mindset of the author does shine through (I thought). And the dialogues, a framing devise to explore the cities, was no less insightful. Commentary on the purpose and meaning of life features (quite a lot of solopsist veering comments dropped in?) This is definitely the kind of book that, if you take the time to think about it, is really rewarding. Also really nice to read something different. Would recommend. 4.5/5 (Sarah, lmk when you're done, have a tonne of notes, there is so much going on in this book! would be keen to chat!) and @Will, deffo worth a read!",2020-04-27 09:42:29,4,en,2020-04-27 09:42:29,4,2020,0.0008,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,350
anna,"So beautiful and impressionistic &lt;3 overall favourite sections would probably be “cities &amp; signs,” “cities &amp; names,” “cities &amp; eyes,” “cities &amp; the sky,” “continuous cities,” “trading cities”Calvino’s writing is soooo delicate n intentional, i frothed over every line. Lots of little gems :)Here is one of them i picked at random:”Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,” Polo said. “Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.”And this one which spoke to me, i read it thinking about the care we owe to each other daily:Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone’s gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others; at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly.Maybe one of invisible cities’ unique qualities is its ability to accomodate for each reader’s own set of thoughts, expressions, interpretations, personal and lived experiences, beliefs. I rarely consider books universal but i think this comes quite close, it does feel like a very timeless tale, v atmospheric and magical. I also read this as a warning, particularly the “continuous cities” sections—narrative is such a powerful tool that Calvino deploys so well to paint a chilling picture of modernity and consequently capitalism/consumerism in these sections specifically, felt more viscerally when contrasted with the romanticism of imperial exploit crossing over with popular myth/legend weaved throughout the book. Much to think about. Mostly i still read this superficially",2020-11-24 08:14:59,4,en,2020-11-24 08:14:59,11,2020,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,296
Ingrida ,"If you're expecting an unputdownable travel adventures story book full of intricate plot twists and relatable characters, this book is everything but that. If I had to pick a genre shelf for this little book, I'd probably say it belongs in philosophical prose poetry, because it reads much more like poetry than some novel (even though Calvino himself seems to have labeled it as a novel).The dialogues between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo seem to be deliberately vague and philosophical and not revealing much about their personalities or a plot backstory, but perhaps it's what I like about it - that you can project your own beliefs onto them. There was this quote that describes the relationship of the reader with this book: “I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. &lt;...&gt; It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”Some of the chapters, labeled Cities and the Dead were amongst my favourites. This particular quote struck a chord with me: “You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.” If you check the wiki page for this book you'll see both a bit pretentious, but also rather fascinating matrix on how Calvino grouped the chapters into patterns - apparently he belonged to a mathematicians/writers group, who seeked new constrained writing patterns, which I find pretty coolio beans.There's a big chance that I'll come back to reading Cities again and again, because it's that easy to pick it up (due to its structure and poetic nature) and delve into Calvino's imagination (no smaller than Borges') and worldbuilding skills. I won't be stingy and give it 5 stars that it deserves.",2018-05-27 18:14:36,5,en,2018-05-27 18:14:36,5,2018,0.00093,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,321
William Adams,"Marco Polo describes the cities he has visited to his host, the emperor Kublai Khan, presumably in the 1200s. The novel is structured like The Arabian Nights, framed by a conversation between the two men then cutting out to descriptions of the cities. The descriptions are narrative expositions. Dialog is nonexistent in the first half and rare throughout. No particular characters are featured other than the traveler himself, Marco Polo, narrating in first-person.Most city descriptions are one to three pages, but there are lot of them. Nine chapters each have five cities described, except for the first and last chapters, which have ten. The descriptions rotate among nine themes, such as memory, desire, the dead. Early descriptions are full of youth, sexual desire and vigor, while the later ones feature decay, garbage, loss, and loneliness. If you think this is a book about cities, you have missed the point. The writing is imaginative and vivid: “Travelers return from the city of Zirma with distinct memories: a blind black man shouting in the crowd, a lunatic teetering on a skyscraper’s cornice, a girl walking with a puma on a leash.” But the writing is also slyly philosophical, so that while it is a short book, it is not a quick read. You often have to stop and think. “Actually many of the blind men who tap their canes on Zirma’s cobblestones are black; in every skyscraper there is someone going mad; all lunatics spend hours on cornices; there is no puma that some girl does not raise, as a whim. The city is redundant: it repeats itself so that something will stick in the mind.” This is my third Calvino novel. The other two were more clever than thoughtful. I like this one best. It would be a rich gold mine of opportunity for any teacher of literature.Calvino, Italo (1972). Invisible Cities.

Alexandra,"""The book I would choose as pillow and plate, alone on a desert island."" - Jeanette WintersonI read this book over the course of nearly six months. On trains, in the corners of cafes, the words surrounding me within a cocoon of imagination and safety. I was among people and yet the background noise faded; I was alone and never felt lonely, choosing the slim volume over and again, its poetry, its visions, the last phrases I wanted to read before I fell asleep, the first ones I wanted to read on a weekend morning, sunlit by quiet and summer and spring. So moved I could-can-hardly express its impact, though I know I am changed for years by the gentle language, the vibrant language, unfolding cities positioned between appearance and disappearance, protrusion and recession, their design eerie and magical, bittersweet and exuberant. Storytelling, language itself, emerges as a way of building and rebuilding, the growth akin to the aging of trees-rings multiplying, a deepening, a thickening, and yet a way of hiding. Here are descriptions of the unseen, or better yet, descriptions of what we would truly see, when we think of fallen cities, changing cities, cities we love, veiled by a simple understanding of buildings and streets. And the cities are like Calvino's writing, not pursuing an end but continuous. Like sound or light or perfume, once read it casts its presence everywhere. Surfaces appear differently; reflections appear as signs appear as coincidences, exhilarating and still enough to evoke a sense of pause.This book is companion and path.

Gabriel Soll,"This is one I'd really love to give 4.5 stars to. This was a little gem of a novel, such as Calvino is wont to produce. Despite its small size, it should not be judged unworthy. My thoughts upon exiting this novel is that I need to find someone I know who is travelling abroad for the first time in their life to give this book to. There is no plot or characters to keep track of...rather musings that one can come in and out of, and I am certain will speak to different people different ways (and most certainly will speak to the same person different ways if reread.)This is an experimental/abstract piece that I found completely compelling despite its lack of plot (it isn't intended to have a plot, so I wasn't expecting one coming in, which might have helped). The descriptions of the various cities (and metaphors) are at once clear and muddy. As an example, Calvino throws in complete anachronisms (Marco Polo discussing his experience at different airports) perhaps to remind the reader of how timeless the thoughts of a traveler can be...and yet, in the context it is unclear if this Marco Polo ever left (or needed to leave) Venice in order to experience the world.Replete with deep thoughts (TM) and wonderful imagery to let the mind wander as it will. I read this looking up from a hammock to view the crashing waves of the Atlantic. I was put in mind of my summers in South America and wished I had had it then. I was happy to find this book at a swap shop in Rockport, MA. While I will enjoy having in on my bookshelf for a while, as soon as I find the right person to pass it along to, I will need to pass it along. It is a book that itself needs to travel along with the minds of its readers.",2018-07-22 01:02:24,4,en,2018-07-22 01:02:24,7,2018,0.00061,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,322
Daniella,"3.5I started reading this in the line of the prefecture in France and it saved me from hours of torturous bureaucracy, so I will thank it for that.I really liked the imagination of this book - describing cities that were all the same, yet making them sound so different. I especially liked the link of cities to the stars, as well as the city that was all outskirts. If anything I think this book showed how in even a couple of pages, places can be created and linked together, yet seem so different from each other. I also liked the idea of cities being perceived differently once you remain there for a long time. Also how the more you see of the world, the more similarities you see between places - searching for the familiar in the unfamiliar.Favourite quotes:""the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there"" (p. 24)""By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches."" (p. 24)""You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living.

Sal,"What a delightful little book. So incredibly imaginative and inspiring. 5/5. I read Invisible Cities as a ""palate cleanser"" after the brilliant behemoth that is War and Peace, and it definitely lived up to my expectations - both as a breath of fresh air and an inspiration for a future architect.With each city that Calvino conjures up, there is a sense of magic, uniquely attached to every separate identity. Some cities horrify the reader with their hideous nature, while others indulge them in fantastical beauty that can only exist in fiction. (My favourite themes were ""Cities and the Dead"" and ""Continuous Cities"" - the stories under those sections were the most memorable for me.)Regardless though, one's imagination is thoroughly nourished as Marco Polo delineates these marvellous images to Kublai Khan. Calvino's dreamy prose transports the reader to a myriad of different realms that pampers their desire for exotic places. In a time like now, where we are stuck in our homes, a book like Invisible Cities is the perfect oasis for a retreat into fantastical worlds. As I linger on the last page, trying to take in all of its beauty. It feels like my brain had just consumed the world's most refreshing and delicious mint. I'm excited to read more of Calvino's works (this was my first Calvino, and such a lovely introduction!); Invisible Cities has claimed a rightful place on my list of all-time favourites.",2021-01-30 22:51:31,5,en,2021-01-30 22:51:31,1,2021,0.00105,0.00011,0.0002,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,237
Ryan,"I most certainly underestimated this work: I initially just believed it was Italo Calvino rattling off as many esoteric words as he could and trying as hard as he can to show off to an obnoxious degree. But going deeper into his work, despite how repetitive the book may be (i.e. ""Check out this city, and this city, and this city..."", and so on). But it is so much better than that.Imagine, if you will, a swirling, dynamic mixture of the vivid imagination of Doctor Seuss's Oh, the places you'll go!, the satirism and wild adventures of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travel's, and the deceptive blending of reality and fiction in Herodotus's ancient, legendary Histories, and you will have some idea of what Calvino's work is like.I'll write a proper review later, but essentially, despite the grinding repetitious format of the work, which is very much a straight travel journal—with the added twist of it being the traveler Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan the nature of the things within his empire—it's very engaging and fun to read. And it's also well worth it on a subtextual/analytical level, too. Because like the aforementioned authors, nothing on the surface is exactly what it seems, and Calvino draws one in to his highly, highly original and lush prose and deftly blends reality vs fiction, and dreaming vs waking life.This short book is well worth anyone's time who wants something original, beautiful, and well-written—so long as they are also patient.",2021-07-24 01:48:53,4,en,2021-07-24 01:48:53,7,2021,0.00083,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,245
Ella Narvasa,"Reading this book was like wandering through the half-remembered landscapes of waking dreams. It was such a wonderful experience that the interludes of the framing story-Marco Polo talking to Kublai Khan- paled in comparison to these snapshots of fantastical cities. Invisible Cities is a sampler of cities that do not exist. It is Marco Polo's report to Kublai Khan, who lives on the verge of despair at the thought of his empire that is beginning to crumble. The cities conjured up on these pages were at once insanely fanciful yet stunningly real. So many of the descriptions were a less than two pages, or even less than one full page, yet they were so evocative that I could almost see them as a panorama in my mind's eye. Some of my favorites were Despina, the city that can be reached by land or by sea, and appears differently to the mariner and the camel-rider; Euphemia, the city where merchants gathered to exchange stories instead of wares; and Octavia, the city built in a spider's web. I loved all the cities, from the strange to the disturbing to the beautiful. I would not want to live in Zobeide, the city whose paths were built by men seeking to trap an unknown woman, but I would also not want to live in Armilla, a city built only of freestanding pipes and plumbing. One particularly lovely aspect of this book was when Kublai Khan asked Marco Polo why he never spoke of Venice, his home city. ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice,"" was Marco's response. I think that I somewhat feel that way about my own city. This book was a glorious exploration of urban beauty and willful otherworldliness, and I'd like to return to it again.",2023-02-03 08:17:35,5,en,2023-02-03 08:17:35,2,2023,0.00076,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,300
Dylan Cuellar,"**highest recommendation**When I took an urban planning class in college, the first day my professor said this book would be required reading if we wanted to continue in this field or any others that is about how to create for human kind. I wholly understand why now. This is a story that is a complete transportation into not necessarily cities but two minds, storytelling and debating mystical places that are said to exist. Each city falls into different types; those of memory, those of names, those of the clouds, those that are continuous, those that are for the dead, and so on. To understand why these cities fall into each category is helpful to understanding that these aren't just travelogues but digressions on what it means to live in a community and how that municipality is built and lived in effects the inhabitants. What causes us to lose hope, or interest, or communication. Most importantly, in the end, how can we preserve the stuff that hasn't fallen into the inferno we create when we have created a world in a world. Furthermore it implies that this might not be a treatise on many cities, but in fact a single city, or all cities at once, and probably the one closest to our heart. For Marco he saw Vienna, for you, you will probably see the city you grew up in as a child only to return to later and realize the stark differences in the landscape since. This added emotional weight brings all those themes to the head for the reader as one travels through Calvino's beautiful prose. At once stream of conscious while meticulously created, it's as close to what the neuron fires tell our brain as we will ever get; the most pure and beautiful thought.",2022-05-27 01:22:04,5,en,2022-05-27 01:22:04,5,2022,0.0008,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,298
Nathaniel,"I will come back, at some later date, to give perhaps a more detailed review of this frankly unbelievable piece of writing. Maybe I won't. In my preliminary research I saw a quote from some notable literary critic - so notable that I can remember neither the name or the quote exactly. In any case, it was something along the lines of: to describe a book like this is to ruin the magic within it. Something like that. It might have been attached to Invisible Cities. It might not have been.Regardless, that sentiment stuck in my head the entire time I was reading this, thinking about how much I would love to recommend this to so many people, and to discuss it with even more. I do not know how I would recommend this book in any way other than the vague dancing-around-the-point I am doing currently.That's why I say maybe I will come back and write something more detailed. But, this seems to be a work that evades any precise description, at least from my inexperienced mind. Unreal imagination. I would have read the entire thing in a day had I not suffered a massive headache/nausea combination in the evening. I almost feel compelled to immediately read this again - but I shall not. I will let the magic rest within me, so that a return will be so much sweeter.~""And Polo said: 'The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together.'""",2022-07-11 01:43:52,5,en,2022-07-11 01:43:52,7,2022,0.0006,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,268
Justin Martin,"For the first two-thirds of this book, I wanted to use it more than I wanted to read it. Its offbeat thoughts on memories, cities, nationhood, daily practice, and its general refutation of ""well, this is just the way things are"" felt less like a gripping story and more like an insightful but indistinctive TED Talk. Yes, I enjoyed imagining a city atop a spider-web, or a city containing crystal balls of all its possible versions, or a city where people migrated en mass every time they felt ashamed. But I wished I was imagining these things on top of something tense - a scaffold, a frame, a story.Well, the frame asserts itself hardcore past the midpoint, as Marco Polo and Kublai Khan make it clear why they argue for things they're revealed to detest: Khan bellows for a vague future he can't visualize, whereas Polo, in his travels, tries futilely to reconstruct his specific past of Venice, using these odd mythical cities as proxies. The fable-like and almost erotic game of chess that these two men play begins as an occasion for the novel, but slowly - with a patience I didn't know Calvino had - becomes the JUSTIFICATION for the novel. The cities are plenty visible, mysterious as they seem at first - more plausible as they go. It's the most plausible thing about the novel that grows to be its fantasy: that the aging relic and the young explorer can heal each other.",2017-08-22 13:41:01,4,en,2017-08-22 13:41:01,8,2017,0.00069,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,246
Aakash Jain,"Having read it twice, it's still hard to pinpoint exactly why I like this book. It contains the same flowery, meandering language, and the same style of aimless narrative, the same schizophrenic leaps from one theme to another as Calvino's ""If on a winter's night a traveler"", a book that I admire far more than I like. Yet here a similar structure works just fine. Being invested in the content certainly helped too.In its descriptions of cities, it's impossible to not think back to cities, localities, cultures, people that you have experienced personally. As the book progresses, these descriptions change focus to observations on the nature of cities, possession, ambition, mortality, legacy, and much more. It never goes into any depth, its aim seems to be to just remind you of a concept and make you think about it. What stands out is the sheer variety of concepts it covers despite its brevity, and the creativity with which they are presented.I cared somewhat less for the interspersed series of conversations between Kublai Khan &amp; Marco Polo. While they were amusing enough, most of them didn't seem to be as meaningful as the rest of the book. Or maybe they just flew over my head.Overall, a book of stunning imagination, that frees itself from expectations of narrative coherence in service of delivering something truly unique.",2020-10-26 11:27:27,4,en,2020-10-26 11:27:27,10,2020,0.00061,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,224
Brittany Picardi Ruiz,"There are some books that are hard to review because they are a hideous literary messes, and one doesn't know where to begin panning them. There are others books that are hard to review because they push one's buttons, making a fair appraisal of them exponentially difficult. And then there are those books that are hard to review because they are too carefully constructed, too subtly and delicately worded, too grand in insight and application, for one possibly to do them justice.Italo Calvino's masterful Invisible Cities is one of the latter sort of books. I could discuss the intricate, dream-like structure of the short episodes and reveries that build the book like the bricks of one of its cities; the jewel-like clarity and poetry of the language; and above all the way the author, like a skillful magician, peels back the veils of our prosaic reality to reveal something far more beautiful, dangerous, and alive--I can tell you about these things, but I'd rather not give away any spoilers and let the book speak for itself.It’s a mercy this book was originally in Italian, lest it be dragged through the muck of every English Literature course and ruined for everyone. It’s poignant yet playful, and ripe with insight.

Doris Gourbere,"‘Perhaps this dialogue of ours is taking place between two beggars nicknamed Kublai Khan and Marco Polo; as they sift through a rubbish heap, piling up rusted flotsam, scraps of cloth, wastepaper, while drunk on the few sips of bad wine, they see all the treasure of the East shine around them.’ ᯈfinished Calvino’s ‘Invisible Cities’ this past weekend and spent a few days this week revisiting my favorite passages. i understand why this is considered an important novel, and the more time i spend with it, the more meaning i find in it, and the more attached i become to it. this is essentially a conversation between Kublai Khan, an emperor, and Marco Polo, a Venetian explorer, who is tasked with exploring Khan’s empire and reporting back to him. none of these cities or foreign lands that Marco Polo describes from his many travels exist, and Khan knows it, but continues to listen with great attention. — ‘Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions. ..’ ‘Non è detto che Kublai Kan creda a tutto quel che dice Marco Polo quando gli descrive le città visitate nelle sue ambascerie..’ — so, what is it about Marco’s tales that commands attention, and what should we make of these invisible cities that are just part of Marco’s imagination? well, that’s the point of the book because there is no plot (or is there?) - there is only a simple interaction in the form of a conversation where meaning and answers lie. i personally really enjoyed this read, and know that i would appreciate it even more if i were to reread it.",2021-06-09 04:57:23,4,en,2021-06-09 04:57:23,6,2021,0.00266,0.00011,0.00031,0.00011,0.00034,0.00023,282
Steph De Mel,"I don't often give five-star reviews, but ""Invisible Cities"" certainly deserves one. This is a collection of brief vignettes, in which Calvino imagines Marco Polo recounting for Kublai Khan the many wondrous cities he has encountered in his travels (which prove rather, in fact, to be varied re-imaginings of a single, beloved city - Venice).Each vignette that Polo (and, by extension, Calvino) produces is more magical and inventive than the next, as though he were a magician with an inexhaustible supply of tricks up his sleeves. ""Invisible Cities"" is, however, no mere feat of entertainment; Calvino's miraculous cities draw on an impressively broad array of subject matter - including, but not limited to, philosophy, science, history, and economics - to grapple intriguingly with questions of human society and the nature of our shared existence.Calvino's writing is poetic, abstruse, and entirely riveting. This book is like nothing I've ever read before, and is so dense with ideas and commentary that it's difficult to believe it's only just over a hundred pages in length.I foresee myself returning to this collection again and again, as it's the type of book that I expect will have some new and interesting dimension to uncover each time. I'm so excited to have discovered it at last, and look forward to picking it up again soon.",2021-09-17 05:14:24,5,en,2021-09-17 05:14:24,9,2021,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,218
Karim Mahamed,"I was not able to finish reading this book in one go (as many others probably did judging from reviews) but I was just as speechless when I got to the last page. Reading this book always changes the atmosphere of reality, takes you to a journey across the world, city after city, of those which exist and others that don't, never did or probably will.I was amazed by the writing. Although it isn't in its native language (I will pick up the Italian version soon), the material is solid and put together in such way that makes it food for your mind! I saved a couple of quotes that I thought were brilliant, and even set a bookmark to all the pages where an ""invisible"" city that I recognized is mentioned.Honestly, I don't consider myself the sharpest reader and at times I might as well just miss or even not understand certain details. I think that Italo Calvino made sure to bring the reader come back to reading this book at least one more time... I will most definitely do so.Now I understand the smile that this book brought to my girlfriend's face when we were in Venice. She who I thank so much for recommending this book to me, and I do the same to whoever thinks about picking this!

Austin,"Calvino has written a highly imaginative, fantastical, dream-like series of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan about the ""cities"" within the Khan's empire. Because none of Polo's descriptions are strictly real, but rather highly impressionistic, philosophical, and musing, the book turns out to be a reflection on the nature of empire, ownership, justice, human relations, architecture, religion, leadership, and much, much more. There are some truly beautiful lines in the book; some of my favorite: --""The triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing."" pg. 5--""You reach a moment in your life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living."" pg. 95--""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; it there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."" pg. 165",2019-09-29 21:05:43,4,en,2019-09-29 21:05:43,9,2019,0.00098,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,211
Ammir,"I'm a sucker for metareferential books, and this is an amazing example of it. On the surface, these 55 Invisible Cities are generally enjoyable to read through (if sometimes strained by the language and repetitiveness), touching on subjects of desires, death, consumerism, and other universal human experiences. Described in surreal magical tones, elements of astrology, divinity, and mathematical concepts are found in the different cities.The conversations between the only two characters gradually shift from a realistic tone into a dreamlike world, where in the end Kublai Khan and Marco Polo question their reality and identities.As Kublai Khan attempts to understand all the emblems in his empire, so he can gain whole knowledge of the empire, we attempt to understand each city so we can unlock the meaning of this book. Both the reader and the emperor are met with the same inexorable futility. To me, this book is about a rigorous system that attempts to classify all knowledge into a set of combinables rules from which we can derive this knowledge, and an obverse limitless imagination that threatens this system with dead ends and recursive loops. The friction between these two forces is the catalyst for true meaning.""it is not the voice that commands the story; it is the ear""",2021-08-22 12:01:24,5,en,2021-08-22 12:01:24,8,2021,0.00527,0.00011,0.00046,0.00015,0.0004,0.00022,210
Liz Pardey,"I read this book in little books, as the structure allows. Marco Polo is with the Khan telling him of the strange cities he has visited. Each city takes one or two pages to describe. As well the book is divided into chapters and cities are classified as Cities and memory, Continuous cities, Cities and signs, Cities and desire, etc etcIt is pretty much impossible to describe what is going on here: Gods of two species protect the city of Leandra. Both are too tiny to be seen and too numerous to be counted. One species stands at the doors f the houses, inside, net to the coatrack and the umbrella stand . . . . The others stay in the kitchen, hiding by preference under pots or in the chimney flue or broom closet. We have the supernatural, everyday life in ancient times, and the odd reference to squeezed tubes of toothpaste, light bulbs, boilers.There is satire -- our drive to always make and have the new for instanceA strange and deceptively simple book. I don't understand it at all; if I was so inclined and had a few days to kill, I would reread it making notes and spreadsheets, finding critical opinion etc etc. As it is I just enjoyed the out-of-body, out-of-time experience with Marco and the Khan.",2018-10-17 02:25:33,4,en,2018-10-17 02:25:33,10,2018,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,221
Geoffrey Fox,"Kublai Khan is the ruler of an empire too vast for him to imagine, so he enlists the young Venetian, Marco Polo, a reknowned traveler, to describe to him the cities he has visited. It is possible that the great Khan's empire exists only in his imagination, and it is more than possible that the cities that Marco Polo describes are his own inventions, inspired at least in part by dream-like transformations of the built reality and social layerings of his native Venice. But the khan's real interest is in understanding himself and his own mind, so when he tires of his young informant's strange descriptions, he prefers to challenge him to serial games of chess. Kublai Khan has no inclination to travel to see his cities for himself, his palace is far too comfortable. What intrigues him, and us, about the cities Marco Polo describes is that each contains some contrary city, one whose design and practices are exactly the opposite of the city first described, and frequently this second city also has its opposite. Invention upon invention, because Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are themselves only creatures of Italo Calvino's imagination, exploring the multiplicity of possible visions and interpretations that each city, like each book, and most explicitly this book, can be read and experienced in multiple, contradictory ways.",2019-01-21 01:43:46,4,en,2019-01-21 01:43:46,1,2019,0.00098,0.00011,0.00018,0.00013,0.00019,0.00016,221
Cara Lee,"This beautiful book turned my world upside down as both a reader and a writer. Italo Calvino overturned my certainty about the elements that fiction must have for it to work. For me, there is no way to categorize Invisible Cities except to call it genius - a word I don't use lightly. At first, I voraciously spun through chapter after chapter, eager to see whether Calvino could keep surprising me with new visions of what a city could be if there were no limitations to imagination. Then I decided I was reading too fast, and this feast would be over all too soon, so I slowed down to savor a couple of cities at a time, marveling at the metaphors, the insights, both the sensory and incorporeal wonders that rose from page after page. Invisible Cities is a story yet not a story, poetry yet not poetry, something profound which opened me to the possibility that perhaps we limit ourselves in the way we perceive and create our internal and external worlds. I would love to see what might happen if this book became assigned reading for everyone who ever had to meet with others to solve a problem, plan a journey, or create a new idea.",2019-03-04 03:06:50,5,en,2019-03-04 03:06:50,3,2019,0.00082,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,208
Megha Chakraborty,"Kublai Khan seeks news of his sprawling empire from his travelling ambassador Marco Polo. The book consists of Polo's descriptions of strange and far-flung cities, punctuated by dialogues with the Khan. Each of these cities, though not lacking physical detail, is distinguished by some thought-provoking singularity that makes it of more interest as a META-physical notion. An unusual book, very entertaining its short and can be finished in two-three days, or you can take your time and read one page a day, totally up to you. Polo describes the personality of the cities to Khan, in a very philosophical way. He is not describing the cities, these cities are parables in themselves with there own personalities. Every chapter is such a delight. I don't want to ruin the experience of reading something so different for you, but I do want you to get a sense of what is waiting for you. There's one city that exists on a spiderweb. One that is built-in men's dreams of chasing a woman. One that has only the plumbing but none of the buildings. One that is built entirely on massive stilts. So many inventive and creative places to visit!! This is a book, that needs re-reading, it's a total experience, a very meditative experience. Highly recommended, you shouldn't miss this. Happy Reading and a happy new year!",2021-01-06 13:10:18,5,en,2021-01-06 13:10:18,1,2021,0.001,0.0001,0.00017,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,224
Jan,"Marco Polo's discoveries made a mark upon history, and his travels provided numerous stories for Kublai Khan and us readers, and then I found it fascinating that Kublai Khan was not always satisfied with what he heard so created stories about places -- cities -- he had never been. Quite rightly, I thought during a break; none of us tells any story exactly the same, nor do we view Life in the same way. Still, there is something about the places we live. They are the vessels that move us through life. Rich with symbolism and full of illusions, these stories and cities intrigued me, yet I wished for a more consistent character with whom I could identify, watch grow, fall and fail, and either seek redemption or resign to the follies of life. Still, I appreciated the intricate passages, rich vocabulary, and unique symbolism. These all created a feast for my listening. As with Italo Calvino's other works, I struggled a bit with concepts and meanings but -- again like with the others -- enjoyed the challenge A bonus to listening on Audible? Listening allowed me to enjoy the whole book and revisit full chapters. I've come to realize, however, how much more I enjoy having the printed words for this particular author whether I listen along or read in silence.

Catalina,"I first read Calvino, by chance, when I was 13. It was 'Difficult Loves'. I don't remember much about the book but I know I liked it enough to make me want to go back to the author. I can't tell what made me wait 25 years to do so, but I'm thankful I finally did it because 'Invisible Cities' just blew my mind.I let myself be transported to the collection of surreal and improbable scenarios this book contains, worlds within worlds that I could never tire of wandering around, places which I enjoy imagining but I'd avoid at all cost if they really existed. Impossible to grasp or pin down, those cities are related to my own states of frustration. They're too close to the amusement of a long exotic dream as well as the fear of the most vivid nightmare. I found myself thinking about places I've dreamed of, cities I want to visit, countries I've lived in. I wish this book had never ended but I'm happy to know that I can go back to it to revisit a world that (fortunately) can't be inhabited, like a dog trying to catch its own tale, finding the greatest pleasure in doing so.",2018-08-01 03:26:52,4,en,2018-08-01 03:26:52,8,2018,0.00085,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,204
Patrick Powers,"A beautifully written collection of things (vignettes, prose poems, whatever you call them). The translation does a wonderful job retaining the lush, reclined indulgence of each line, and it’s very pleasing to read. In this way it reminds me of Cortazar. However, the book also shares issues with Cortazar’s work. While the indulgent beauty of the prose makes Invisible Cities enjoyable, it can become overly pretentious at times. Much like Cortazar’s group of wayward intellectuals in Rayuela, Kublai Kahn and Marco Polo become, after the initial joy of savoring the author’s pretty words, all too reminiscent of the real men we all know who are obnoxiously in love with their (our) own intellectualism. While the pieces are lovely at times, they just as often seem like the same things two college students say to eachother about the world when they’re sitting around their (our) dorm getting high. In all, this book has sort of become my benchmark for 3 stars.

Now for the part I am ashamed to say:I am not intellectual enough to love Calvino. I was enchanted by the lovely descriptions of cities and the thoughtful conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, but I thought this book was quite repetitive... found myself skimming quite often.... at which point I had to go back and reread the whole part..... bit of a shame because I really did enjoy If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.... Perhaps it would've been better had I read this in little bites... over the course of days and weeks.... rather than in one afternoon and evening...... but oh well..... i didn't.... because.....A considerable (more than I'm willing to admit) part of why I read this book today is because A) I thought it would be very fitting to start and end my year with Italo Calvino, and B) I could NOT let Colleen Hoover be the last book of 2022.....

Miriam,"Gore Vidal told me I would love this book. Reading this book makes me trust Gore Vidal less.I did not get a lot out of this book. It has many vivid images, but I'm not sure what the point is. Cities have many contrasts: they are similar/different, high/low, beautiful/ugly, young/old, traditional/new, dark/light, living/dead, and many other pairs. The juxtapositions are interesting, I guess, but, still: to what end?Eventually I was disturbed by the feminine names of most of the cities--are these just women in Calvino's life in disguise? The only city that sticks with me is the one in which astrologers mapped out the best route to capture to fortune of the heavens. But it's a city of deformed people, which means they have to admit either their calculations were wrong or that this city IS the perfect embodiment of the gods' laws, making the gods monstrous as well.

Each few pages tells the story of another city, another way of community, another structure of trade and family. And intertwined is a conversation between a no name explorer and the leader of a giant expansive empire. And both discuss that maybe they are just two hobos picking up trash discussing cities they have never seen. Or maybe they are just speaking of different parts of one town. The cities described are poetic and make you question why towns ARE like that or why cities ARE NOT like that? Why do we build, we do we design, why do we ever leave?

Junesoo,"3.5/5This book is 55 very brief meditations on imagined cities past, present, future, and some not strictly on the timeline at all. Interspersed throughout is a framing device in the form of an unfolding dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, discussing the pockets of the Khan's vast empire in their various states of flourishing and decay.Each ""city"" you visit is more of a parable exploring the forces of time, death, language, etc., and their power to shape the things we create; cities far more fantastical than anything that might be imagined as an actual place on a map. There's a wonderful oneiric quality to Calvino's writing that comes with the blurring and inversion of boundaries - those between life and death, earth and sky, air and dirt, past and present, picture and pictured: inside and outside.Exquisite, in small doses and at first.

Mo David,"Like most people, Invisible Cities was my first step into the Calvinian multiverse. I read this book at the insistence of a dear friend who knew before I did the exact kind of lightness I was lacking. It is always an odd thing to read another man's dream journal... Will his mythologies mean much to me? Can the words be trusted to suspend a bridge between our separate minds? Language remains a frustrating and imperfect means of communication... But writers like Calvino restore hope that there is a way to wield it and yield bits of understanding, to smuggle ""moods, states of grace, elegies"" across imaginary borders. Invisible Cities is a sacred reminder that the traveler/bandit/vagabond is perhaps the only person who can see the world for what it really is.

Erik Duemig,"A poet tells a philosopher about Cities. Cities and Memory. Cities and Desire. Cities and Signs. Thin Cities. Trading Cities. Cities and Eyes. Cities and Names. Cities and The Dead. Cities and The Sky. Continuous Cities. Hidden Cities. These vignettes of reverie, aligned in a series that can easily be read out-of-order and with nothing lost on the reader, function both 1.) to instill a sense of world-wonder and 2.) to use the peculiarities of these various places to point, mysteriously, at something profound. Conceptually this book is very dense, but it reads with a dreamy lightness, like a gifted storyteller talking a child to sleep.

Dan Trefethen,"The conceit of this book is that Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are sitting together, and the Khan wishes to know the types of cities that Polo has seen in his travels. But are they really sitting together talking? Are they just sitting quietly, smoking pipes, and each imagining the other talking about cities, which may be imaginary? Does it matter?This book has long been considered an ur-text for many writers of urban fantasy, so I thought I'd better read it. It consists mainly of short (some only one page) descriptions of various imaginary cities, each with different attributes. Today, you might call each description a piece of flash fiction. Together, it presents a number of questions: What is a city? How is it perceived by its occupants? Is a city different for every occupant? Are cities really different from each other?This is a fast read, only 165 pages. Regardless of what you think is happening (or not happening) with Polo and the Khan, the descriptions of 55 cities is a pleasure; each one a mini-travelogue and minor philosophical puzzle.",2019-04-08 11:38:54,4,en,2019-04-08 11:38:54,4,2019,0.00071,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,180
Sierra,"""Perinthia's astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in the city of monsters.""This is a rare book that I have chosen to savor—it has taken me over a month to read its brief 165 pages (often punctuated by blank space and margins). And every second of emptiness between descriptions of the cities that Calvino uses to portray humanity has been worth it. This is the sort of masterpiece that takes time to envision and reflect. This is the sort of book that will stick with you forever. Calvino is brilliant, Piglia *must* have named La ciudad ausente as a reference to this, and I continue to be obsessed with both.",2020-09-05 12:26:01,5,en,2020-09-05 12:26:01,9,2020,0.00089,0.00011,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,143
Alicia Fenney,"Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities is an incredible reading experience and I'm grateful for the requirement in my Travel Writing class. Although it is a novel, there is much a writer can take away from the structure and style of the novel. A fictitious exchange between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan features philosophic discussion between the two men: the former meant to travel and share his travels with the latter. Between philosophic discussion are 1-2 page narrative prose on each of the 55 imaginary cities Polo has visited. The cities are fantastic, dystopian, parable, and eerily realistic at least in a small way. Each city teaches the reader alongside Khan a lesson about life, death, the world, the universe and our place in it. What happens when designers try to control the stars? Polo seems to argue as he juxtaposes a city engineered to perfection that is reflected on the micro and macro scales, to a city full of monsters, whose engineers discuss how to inform its inhabitants of their mistake, or if, indeed, they have even made one?What exists beyond our cities and at what stage will our own waste touch the borders of others', causing our existence to crater and avalanche in on us? Are all cities, all civilizations, suspended on a web, which if a single line is cut will cause their demise? I read this book in one sitting and it did not disappoint, although left my head spinning and full of questions that cannot be answered. Highly recommended.",2021-06-29 07:23:58,5,en,2021-06-29 07:23:58,6,2021,0.00101,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00017,252
Arun,"This book reminds me of sitting on the N train that exits the tunnel from Lexington Avenue and rises above ground towards Queensboro Plaza. It’s past sunset, and I’m sitting by the window, looking at all the pretty lit up apartment buildings and offices where people are just living their own lives. It’s a psychedelic feeling, just like this book—it’s strange and different. I like to think that I have a very strong imagination, so reading this was really fun and intriguing because Italo Calvino puts so much thought and detail behind everything needed to construct each of these imaginary cities. It’s just a very hyper-descriptive world, and now I really want to visit some of the places mentioned like Chloe, Phyllis, Irene, and Raissa even though they all concoct Venice. It's also not just about architecture but also about the human experience, broken down into themes like memory and desire. When I found out that the structure of the book followed an intricate mathematical pattern, I was even more mesmerized. So much precision and thought went into this book. This is a rare, complicated, and beautiful piece of prose.",2022-11-19 09:03:40,4,en,2022-11-19 09:03:40,11,2022,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,190
Joe,"This book does not have a plot, but acts much like a collection of poems. Each ‘poem’ only a page or two depicts a city (usually fictitious), but neglects to describe the actually city. They often takes a moment from the city, it’s vibe, or the attitude of it. A city that has an identical architecture underground for the dead. A city with strings from building to building marking every relationship of its residents. A city that is forever in construction to avoid destruction.There is a *very* light “plot” of Marco Polo describing these cities to Kublai Khan, but their inclusion is much more philosophical than story. I definitely didn’t understand everything this book had to offer because there appears to be a lot of subtleties in subtext. Overall, a short, poetic book for a casual read that does not fit in a genre neatly",2023-01-02 11:17:10,4,en,2023-01-02 11:17:10,1,2023,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,145
Elizabeth,"I did not love this book as much as I should have but that's on me. It's such an insightful, beautiful piece of writing. There are parts that are so powerful in their imagery and emotion that they make you stop. I've expressed that I found the language a challenge and thought it might have been the translation. It's worth finding a translation the suits you and keeping it forever. Or if you can, reading it in the original Italian. This is my first Calvino book but won't be my last. I also found that being away from a 'city' made reading this more enjoyable. It's meant to invoke memories, imagery is easier to do when you're away from a place.

enricocioni,"A mesmerising, cerebral-yet-lyrical prose-poetic exploration of the way we experience cities (and other places) not so much as literal, physical locations, but as imaginary constructs borne out of our own memories, desires, fears, abstract classification schemes, and so on. Often the way a city is described feels like a puzzle, or a riddle--some easy to solve, others less so. William Weaver's translation is pretty much perfect, and adds some extra heft and gravitas (among other things, by adding punctuation) to Calvino's original.

Riitta,"Totally mind-blowing! Reading Invisible Cities I suddenly remembered why I was so impressed by Calvino’s books in my early twenties. I want to reread them all! The final words of this incredible book (no spoiler): “The infierno of the living is not something that will be: if there is one, it is what is already here, the infierno where we live every day, that we form by living together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the infierno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.

Joe Baz,"Full disclosure, this is one of my favorite books. This is either my third or fourth time reading it. (And I don't care if book club sees my rating. I already told them it's one of my faves.)For me, each story straddles the barrier between narrative and prose. Each city tries to reach something elemental, deep in the nature of the world. But, like so many fragments and poems, most offer more questions than answers. Each city is deliberate and meandering, opaquely clear. It is like being in a museum: I see things I don't fully understand, but in their very placement I imagine they have some importance. I can't decipher the chapter titles. Many of the words are new or unknown to me.

Roxerg,"Meditations on the soul, meaning, and interpretation of cities. Also of language and memory itself? There were cities that, for one reason or another, stuck in my memory, be it for the vivid picture they drew in imagination, or of their concept, expressing something about its inhabitants, about people in general. But while the cities were significant points in Marco Polo's travel, their sections to me were as the fields and plains to him, with the promise of another dialogue between the Traveller and Khan waiting for me at their terminus. As the stories give a unique perspective on the cities, the conversations of these two give a unique perspective on the stories themselves, spiralling the reader into a web of interpretation and reinterpretation, where there is no choice but to treat feeling, an experience, as the ultimate truth.

Anirud Thyagharajan,"Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino is a fictional essay of dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, with the former narrating accounts of magically realistic cities that Marco witnesses during his tours. Calvino is a master of words and worlds, creating very concise descriptions of a multitude of cities, each occupying a unique position in the reader's minds. Some of the conversations/thoughts between Khan and Polo are beautiful, expressing the dream-like nature of many cities, cities coalescing into one another, being limitless, being regenerative, having unique relations between the living and the dead, and playing with your memories. At most times, the prose almost reads like poetry.

James Martin,"Invisible Cities is a great little book, unlike any other I've ever read. Having first discovered Calvino's work through If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, and dabbled with a few others here and there, this is only the second of his books I've read entirely. And his range--based on just those two works--is an amazing thing. Invisible Cities contains some beautiful writing. It's part travelogue, part fantasy, part philosophical meditation, and part hallucinatory trip. It's like a Dr. Seuss book for grownups. It really defies description. It's a brief and worthwhile literary experiment. On the strength of these two, I'm already looking forward the next book I'll read by Calvino.

Zach,"I don't know why all the top reviews for this book are so long. The book itself is very short and can be finished in a day or two, and the staccato structure and small, dream-like descriptions make this book hard to pin down when reviewing it. There's really no alternative to simply picking it up and reading it on your own. But, if you decide to do so then you might discover, like I did, that it's one of those rare books that lingers in your mind long after you finish; subtly yet significantly shifting something inside you. And in all the imaginary cities Marco Polo described I saw reflected a hint of some real place: some real city I had lived in, traveled through or read about. It's a magic little book, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Also, I would love to see a Minecraft streamer attempt to recreate some of the more physically-described cities.

It is as thin as the city of Zenobia, with its ladders and hanging sidewalks and houses of bamboo and zinc, but its sentences are long and at times unnecessarily complex and confusing, much like the streets of Cecilia, an illustrious city. For those who read it without passion, the book is one thing; it is another for those who are fascinated by it and always return to it. I, sire, am perhaps neither – hence my three star rating.

Consisting mostly of page-long vignettes which are equally intriguing, thought-provoking and astonishing. Not only are they original, but they can be reread to discover new and new layers of meaning each time. Such a simple, effective way to capture the essence of something as gigantic, ephemeral and complicated as the nature of cities.

Kārlis,"I kinda have a love/hate relationship with this book. On one hand, I loved how each description gave a thought kernel, something to ponder, a really complicated moral that's reminiscent of Aesop's Fables. On the other hand, there was no narrative, no character development (yes, there were conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, but that felt more like teasing than an actual story), there were just truth/metaphor bombs being dropped one after another. However, I started to accept the book's style at the end of it, and I started to really enjoy how thought provoking it was. My favourite city is Hersilia AKA ""The City of Autists"" as it was the perfect city for understanding social relationships by representing them in the real world (in this case, with differently coloured strings).",2018-01-23 23:34:10,4,en,2018-01-23 23:34:10,1,2018,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,132

Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.

But the special quality of this city for the man who arrives there on a September evening, when the days are growing shorter and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls and from a terrace a woman's voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy toward those who now believe they have once before lived an evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that time.But the later ones tend to be repetitive and stale.

Alison (Marie),3.5 StarsI would like to reread this. I tried to read it too quickly and in a distracting environment and I don’t think that’s how this book should be read. It should be read deeply and carefully to understand all of the nuances (at least for me) and I want to give it that time and devotion. So for now I will not give a full review. I will say that I think this book is very smart. I think it is portraying the deeper parts of what makes up society. But I need to look at it harder to fully grasp more.

Roy,"“Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone’s gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly.”Oddly reminiscent of both ‘Thus Spoke Zarathustra’ by Nietzsche, and ‘The Prophet’ by Ghibran.

Joey Fogarty,"2023 reads, 1/12:“I shall begin by asking you about a city of stairs, exposed to the sirocco, on a half-moon bay. Now I shall list some of the wonders it contains: a glass tank high as a cathedral so people can follow the swimming and flying of the swallow fish and draw auguries from them; a palm tree which plays the harp with its fronds in the wind; a square with a horseshoe marble table around it, a marble tablecloth, set with foods and beverages also of marble.”Magical realism abounds in this 1972 novel (collection?) from Italo Calvino, an author that has been on my radar for a long time. These are not short stories, but rather a collection of descriptions of imaginary cities that explorer Marco Polo is describing to the emperor Kublai Khan. Although they do not speak the same language, this is a nonissue, because Marco Polo uses dances, objects, and visualizations to describe the cities to Khan. Their relationship (which we learn more about during the interludes) is one based off of understanding one another with unspoken words.But to us readers, however, Calvino utilizes the perfect mix of vivid imagery (to describe the physical features of cities) and storytelling of the people, spirits, and culture that make up these cities. To me, this is a master craft on visualization, and I cannot recommend it enough – 2023 is starting off strong.“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”BONUS – some of my favorite cities include (and this list does not give any justice to the descriptions in the book):-	Zaira (Cities and Memory 3), a city that does not measure physical space, but “relationships between the measurements of its space and the events of its past”-	Despina (Cities and Desire 3), a city which can be reached by either ocean or desert, and depending on where you enter, you always desire the other side (a perfect metaphor for ‘the grass is always greener’)-	Euphemia (Trading Cities 1), a city which sets up a trading bazaar to not only trade wares, but memories of each other’s lives-	Adelma (Cities and The Dead 2), a city where everyone you meet resembles someone that you knew before they died",2023-01-05 11:49:03,5,en,2023-01-05 11:49:03,1,2023,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,388

Laura Alice Watt,"Calvino is the master of odd ""concept"" books, and this is another of those. The premise is that Marco Polo is telling Kublai Khan tales of the cities that he has seen in his travels -- the description of each is only one or two pages, and they are arranged in a complex pattern of categories: cities and memory, thin cities, trading cities, cities and eyes, cities and names, etc. Each city is beautifully drawn out, and eventually are revealed to be in truth just one city: ""At times all I need is a brief glimpse, an opening in the midst of an incongruous landscape, a glint of lights in the fog, the dialog of two passersby meeting in the crowd, and I think that, setting out from there, I will put together, piece by piece, the perfect city, made of fragments mixed with the rest, of instants separated by intervals, of signals one sends out, not knowing who receives them.""

Rocco Versaci,"4.5 - Like other books of Calvino’s that I’ve read, this one is strange and imaginative, filled with haunting, thoughtful, precisely-described passages. The situation here is simple: Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan the various cities he has visited throughout his empire, and the majority of this slim book is filled with these fanciful sketches. But the book cuts deeper than this, leading the reader on a journey into considering the nature of imagination, spaces, history, progress, and how our existence is tied to others.",2021-01-25 21:03:20,4,en,2021-01-25 21:03:20,1,2021,0.0006,0.00013,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,85
Caroline,"Kinda had no idea what was going on or what Calvino’s point was at any given time, especially when it got more abstract, but there was always something that would resonate with me or change the way I think about cities and relationships in my own life regardless of what Calvino was or wasn’t trying to say, and isn’t that sort of the point of literature? To present your truths and let people discover their own truths through them? Oof wait maybe I’ve spent too much time with this book, that got needlessly dramatic (but I stand by it)",2021-02-05 12:27:58,5,en,2021-02-05 12:27:58,2,2021,0.00089,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,99
James Horn,"Invisible Cities is a true curiosity and an undeniable work of creative genius. A fictional Marco Polo delivers beautiful poetic descriptions of the architecture, culture and intricacies which breathe vivacious life into Calvino’s imagined cities. These depictions are framed by equally profound and sagacious conversations with Kublai Khan. I personally found the book occasionally repetitive despite its short length, and the format and dense prose is likely not for everyone, but for an open mind, a true love of imagination can be found crackling through these pages like static electricity through a wool blanket.",2021-02-07 07:21:40,4,en,2021-02-07 07:21:40,2,2021,0.00072,0.00012,0.00016,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,94
Ross,"This book is like walking through a dream that I barely remember, where we inhabit Calvino's ethereal web of distant memories - I can't quite work out if they belong to me or not. Through the poetic retelling of an empire emissary of distant cities, we begin to explore topics of the meaning of life; relativism; and existentialism, all shrouded in the mists of a dream like state.Though difficult to quantify the intentions of the book; major themes, or category within which it falls, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face throughout the entire reading. A journey exploring cities we haven't seen yet and may never will, meeting people we may have met, and thinking through what might have been.",2022-11-22 02:13:56,4,en,2022-11-22 02:13:56,11,2022,0.00082,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,121
Jonathan,"A series of prose poems describing metaphorical cities set within the framing device of a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Through his accounts of cities visited in his travels, Polo explores the nature of memory, language, and reality. Meanwhile, Kublai Khan meditates on the limits of empire, on decay and oblivion. It's a collection of premises for fantastical worlds that spends little time lingering on an idea before jumping to something new. The cities of Beszel and Ul Qoma from The City &amp; The City by China Miéville would be right at home amongst Polo's descriptions.",2023-01-17 03:57:27,5,en,2023-01-17 03:57:27,1,2023,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,98

Ritesh Kukrety,"Ever-changingly constant, permanent and ephemeral, Invisible Cities is what we see in front of our eyes every day and what hides within its facades, within its layers, within itself. Illusory, like the gentle wind whispering unknown secrets in your ears, this remarkable fable is about cities. No, it is about the memory of cities, and how a single city can take on different aspects, depending what you remember of it. It is about lives of the people who live in those cities, whether dead or as of yet unborn, just as much as it is about the lives of cities themselves. A fantastic character study, a delightful philosophical exploration, a wonderful reading experience.",2017-10-03 20:33:02,4,en,2017-10-03 20:33:02,10,2017,0.00061,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,113
Emma Iadanza,"I read somewhere that perhaps <em>Invisible Cities</em> is more of a collection of prose poems than an actual novel; I would agree. The language was so beautiful, and the message so deeply engrained in the words.

N.M.,"Wonderful book. Calvino does an amazing job at painting a picture of each city that he came across on his journey. This would be a five star read if there was some true plot. I understand how that doesn't at all fit this book, but reading a story with no true plot development isn't really something I'm keen on.

Stephen Miller,"4.5/5. Gorgeous, beguiling, and somehow irresistible even as I have no real grasp on what it means. Started and finished this on a single plane ride, enthralled. The form factor (extremely short travelogues interspersed with philosophic interludes) really strengthens Calvino’s writing: where If On A Winter’s Night A Traveler’s beauty started to strain under narrative halfway through, here it’s nothing but fluid, beautiful mystery.

David,"Intriguing little book in which Calvino imagines Marco Polo telling the Kublai Khan of his travels around the Empire. Polo describes each city he has visited.

Christine,"Invisible Cities is written so poetically, and each city described like a dream. He really captures the essence of travel: how we desire to discover new places, new people, new experiences. Some cities were shaped by how we perceive them; others evolve through time.

But until the end, I still didn't get what's the deal with the design of the book, and what was it that it's trying to achieve by structuring itself in such an odd way.

Kasandra,"My favorite by Calvino, I re-read this at least once every year or two. And every time I go back to it, I find new details to inspire me, new images that make me laugh or sigh or lose myself in a not-unpleasant rabbit hole of ponderings. Magical, poetic, poignant, radiant, this is a ""take to a desert island"" book if ever there was one. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

John,"It was like an extended version of one of Borges's short stories, but not as good. As creative as the use of the city-as-metaphor is throughout, it has overstayed its welcome by the end. It's also a little annoying that there is an ongoing variation of ""the point is that there is no point"", which could've been guessed by page 5. It seems people seem to really like a line on the last page about escaping hell on earth by finding people who aren't hell, but that seems more autobiographical than anything else. Having suffered under fascism and then been a disappointed communist, I suppose you can understand Calvino's admittance that all he has left is a nihilistic surrender to pleasure. All greater cities of meaning have crumbled.",2022-07-18 01:27:04,3,en,2022-07-18 01:27:04,7,2022,0.00148,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.00021,0.00018,128

Sarah Khan,"I do not know , what to write about this one, I have not read a book like this no characters , no plots but still you have a lot of ideas floating around. The book has very lyrical prose style to it, even though I read translated version of it.Marco Polo describes imaginary cities of Kublai Khan's empire to him , giving vivid descriptions. He considers everything from cities to objects all born out of figments of human memory and can have varied image because perception is individualistic. It talk about how experiences , memories, perception all can have an influence on human lives. Throws light over the fact that as a human we can never be satisfied with one thing or place, we will always look forward to something new. We also, arrive at a place where we are content only when we are old , and there are just so many thing that this book tells in very few words. It will force you to retrospect in many places.During the first one third of the book, I was just unable to make out anything except that these cities do have some meaning but how does it all fit together as a whole was out of my comprehension and I was very irritated and bored as I was not getting anywhere.This is a book meant to be read many times, to capture all ideas and I think rereading will be better as it will give me more insights and I will avoid the first time impatience which I had while reading.3 stars because it was very tough for me and not easy to comprehend first time.",2021-01-01 23:42:18,3,en,2021-01-01 23:42:18,1,2021,0.00062,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,278

Jack,"3.5So this was very different to my normal style of things. Much more capital L literature, I feel. Something you could study in school. I'm not sure I really enjoyed it, but now and again I could see what it was that people liked about it. It's very novel in both its style and its format. Marco Polo telling page sized stories of cities he's been to. You get a decent feel for the cities, however, it is jarring jumping from one to another, never staying long.

Keenan,"This book is a beckoning call to see the whole of human output as an active exercise in the imagination. Cities, like relationships, buildings, children, and artwork, are as much a product of desire and necessity as they are of creativity. Just as the Khan always sees Polo's cities through the lens of his experience, all 55 of Calvino's invisible cities (not imaginary!) have just enough detail to take shape in the mind of the reader as a description of some deep truth or a place they've travelled before.I recall a game Richard Feynman said he played as a kid with his dad, where his dad would describe some everyday object from a point of view beyond the human experience (a shaggy rug becomes a flat land of tubular trees, equally spaced, with giant gray round bunnies below the surface). Reading Invisible Cities felt like playing the same game with the author, him asking us to figure out some deep truth from his imaginative descriptions.",2018-07-25 19:53:06,5,en,2018-07-25 19:53:06,7,2018,0.0008,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,165

Deborah Edwards,"There is a reason Italo Calvino's cities are invisible. It is not just that his tale is set in an earlier time period with cities that may no longer exist in their ancient forms. Nor is it just that a city is a sociological beast, a place that only exists as defined by a group of people who populate it on a particular date in history, slightly different the day before or the day yet to come. Calvino knows that each city is a dynamic, ever-changing social habitat couched in struts and beams, offering its own unique resources for consumption, but existing wholly as an imagined construction, a hollow shell without the plans and needs of those who reside there. Calvino's cities are the cities of the mind, places that spring from the imagination, some of which can only exist because someone has thought of them. And some are not cities at all. If a review that begins with such a conceptual framework is intriguing to you, then you should put ""Invisible Cities"" on your ""to-read"" list immediately. If not, I recommend passing it by. And I seriously mean that, with no judgment one way or the other. This a book for lovers of abstract thought, for those who enjoy having their perspectives challenged and who do not mind being led by confusing clues into disorienting places only to find that any answers that ultimately come, do so, as usual, from within. Unconventional notions, a loose framework housing flights of fancy and raw emotion, horror rendered as poetry, desires built into cities, cities made into women, it all gets a bit heady at times. If you like a straightforward narrative that is either plot-driven or character-driven and has clear situations that are ultimately resolved, you will not enjoy this book. There is no plot. There are two characters, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, and even though we know they existed and are quite real in the records of history, this is not Khan and Polo, but creations of who Khan and Polo might be as imagined by Calvino for the purposes of embodying other entities, perhaps his own, or perhaps those of society at large, or perhaps both. There is no story, per se, except the one important linear thread: Polo describes a series of cities to Khan that are meant to embody the cities of Khan's own crumbling empire. We learn along the way, however, that these cities are most likely not cities Polo has seen on his travels, (some are not even cities that could logistically exist), but are an inner city that Polo decribes differently every time, depending upon his particular mood, viewpoint, outlook on humanity, relationship with desire or mortality, philosophical bent or ideological perspective. Khan comes to believe that each description is a different take on Polo's own home city of Venice, and that every city reflects every other city in the end. As you can see, this is that rare conceptual piece that is about, well, everyone. It is about society and social constructs in its depictions of fantastical cities and the people who build them and reside in them, and it is about the individual in that no city exists without first residing as an image in the mind of a creator, and no inhabitant has an image of his own city that is not informed by his own psychology or philosophy. Calvino echoes what Anais Nin once brilliantly observed, ""We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are."" How Calvino's cities take shape also provide commentary on the human condition. Some are formed out of fear, out of desire, out of a yearning for lost youth or as a makeshift response to war or forced exodus. Oh, and each city is named for a woman. Make of that what you will. The book has surely been compared to many other famous works, although it resembles nothing conceived before. For my part, as I read it, I was reminded of two other works, one ancient and one modern. In its lush, textural and exotic descriptions and its framework of stories being told to appease and entertain a powerful ruler, it reminded me of ""1001 Arabian Nights."" The dynamic, the stories, all quite different, but still the reference to that work is not lost on the reader if only due to the parallels of nightly stories and ancient origins. Oddly, the modern work that paralleled this one for me was ""Einstein's Dreams."" Like ""Invisible Cities"" that book offered mind-altering perspectives of one concept (time) told in a series of short vignettes, each of which contains a new look at an old theme and a conceptual framework that challenges the reader, both in terms of the abstract world of physics and the abstract world of philosophy. Calvino similarly offers stunning vistas of the mind in his series of vignettes about one subject, cities. Cities and Signs, Cities and Desire, Thin Cities. Calvino describes these and many others for us to ponder and explore in the realms of our own imaginations, but in the end, all of them have one distinguishing feature. They are all, collectively, invisible.",2009-09-21 21:36:08,4,en,2009-09-21 21:36:08,9,2009,0.00081,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,866

Calvino’s oblique and fanciful account of Marco Polo's journeys perfectly captures the endless fascination of cites old and new as well as those you've perhaps only explored in your dreams.,2023-01-02 11:47:40,5,en,2023-01-02 11:47:40,1,2023,0.00061,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,0.00018,0.00015,44

Chad,"At some point in the past, I got it into my head that Italo Calvino was really hip. I'm not sure why, as none of my friends have read him, I didn't study him in college, and hadn't actually even heard of him aside from seeing some of his shortish novels lined up on the shelves at Half-Price Books. Maybe its his name, which is all European and cool, combined with what is admittedly a pretty enticing title to his most famous work, ""If On A Winter's Night A Traveler"".Apparently that's enough to impress me. So, I bought up a handful of his books, then forgot about them as they sat in a stack under my old desk. Impressive.Usually at the beginning of a given year, I try to read something unexpected. I like to surprise myself by digging around and reading something halfway to the bottom of a stack or lost in the shadows of something like, oh, I don't know, say, my old desk.So that brought me to Calvino, who I hadn't though about in quite some time. The above mentioned novel (""If On A Winter's blah blah blah) was the obvious choice, so I immediately set it aside. Never go for the obvious. Next in line was ""Invisible Cities"". I took it with me to lunch, then cracked it open to see if Calvino could live up to whatever the heck it was I had thought of him two years ago.It was a slow start. In essence, the book is a series of portraits of strange and sometimes magical cities discovered over the course of the travels of the explorer, Marco Polo. The novel begins with a framing sequence in which Polo describes cities he's visited to the aging emperor, Kublai Khan. These sequences open and close the novel, and similar sequences are interspered throughout the book. As my experience went, these were the weakest parts of the novel. Not necessarily because of anything Calvino does, but moreso because I just didn't really get it sometimes. Its beautiful language, but it seemed to be overly opaque and poetic. I'm sure greater scholars than me find this beautiful and transcendent, but I just found it a bit of a slog and it put me in a negative frame of mind as the book moved into the cities themselves. (btw, I find this happens also sometimes when I read Donald Barthelme.)Thankfully, Calvino moves beyond such overly convoluted verbal gymnastics and slips into the first of 55 dream-like studies of the eponymous cities. I won't go into the details of each city, other than to say each portait is about 3 pages long, and each is stunningly imaginative. The landscapes Calvino paints are beautifully rendered, but more beautiful than the descriptions themselves are the ideas behind the cities. I read the cities almost as little puzzles to be solved with rules that defied anything in reality, but were consistant within the conventions of the story. Calvino applies his playfulness to creating cities with unfamiliar and unexpected rules regarding time, memory, language, light, gender, geography, and on an on an on.What you end up with as you flip past the final page, isn't so much a story, as much as a flip book of Marco Polo's journeys. Except the cities he visits are all impossible, and the only way you can see them is via Calvino's words, which recreate the impossible cities in your mind, where silly things like logic, physics, and common sense can be tweaked and nudged into new things.And as a side note, I have to throw in a quick word about something that usually woudln't really effect my reading experience, and that was the font of the chapter headings. I had a friend several years ago who could name any font he saw (and collected them, as a matter of fact, on his computer). I can't do that, so much, so I can just say that the font is very obviously, and I suspect deliberately, modern: big slanted blocky shadows that produce the words in sharp relief. Its such a strange choice either by author or editor, but juxtaposed against the against the ghostly, ancient atmosphere of the actual text of the book, it creates this weird dichotomy as your reading that...well, that something.Anyhow, in the end, I really enjoyed what I read. I haven't had any great desire to pick up a next Calvino novel, but in the moment, I was genuinly impressed by the ethereal worlds to which I had been taken. And now I have a real opinion of the man; something beyond that weird faux-impression I had when his books just collected dust under my desk. The man is an honest-to-god poet, and his brain goes places that aren't obvious, and he does a rather convincing job of helping you see these places as if, somewhere in between the seconds, underneath the shadows, behind the words we use to express ourselves, the invisible cities of Marco Polo might actually exist.",2008-08-20 12:21:27,4,en,2008-08-20 12:21:27,8,2008,0.00109,0.00011,0.00022,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,837

Andrea,"And Polo said: ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.""""When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them. And about Venice when I ask you about Venice.""""To distinguish other cities' qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice."" (78)This is all about Venice, so says the back and so says the passage above. So why is it European traveler Marco Polo expounding upon, explaining cities to emperor Kublai Khan? Why are these cities all set in the East, reimagined with camels and goats and that fantastical but fairly boring and predictable menagerie of dwarves and bearded women and other familiar sideshow freaks, or naked women of astounding beauty? Why do all the fabled cities seem to have the names of women, are referred to as female and lie there fairly inert for male gazes, male discoveries, male nudges and winks? Perhaps Khan captures it all when he says to Polo:...So then, yours is truly a journey through memory!...It was to slough off a burden of nostalgia that you went so far away!"" (88)But how boring that this is once more a novel of ennui, however unusual. How predictable, how everything-Said-wrote about orientalism and it being nothing more than European fears and desires on display, picked and mixed in the furtherance of domination. It may be meant as an immensely clever and witty exploration of just such a phenomenon, but I don't think it escapes it.These short vignettes, labeled things such as 'Thin Cities', 'Trading Cities', 'Cities &amp; Desire', 'Cities &amp; Signs', one could almost believe them intellectual exercises if they did not also seem to be named after former lovers. Perhaps those are not mutually exclusive. Each describes a city and ends in a paragraph of lofty metaphor that perhaps has something to do with its category. Perhaps not.Some of these are lovely. Yet for me they could not escape my distaste with this form, they seemed forced somehow, like the intellectual boys in university trying to one-up one another over dinner. This has been on my list to read for ages, pushed forward by a quote I loved in Nabeel Hamdi's book on development, 
  <em>Small Change</em>
, he quoted this:However, it is pointless to try to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into a different two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give form to their desires and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.It is so true we are both shaped by and shape our cities, and this reminded me of the rallying call around building the city of our heart's desire (I knew it from Harvey, but I just read it somewhere else and quite remember where but was surprised...).So alone I rather like some of these thoughts, they deserve more attention perhaps. but I wonder if they are not just empty cleverness. I have copied a few last sentences that I think could be either...Desires are already memories (7)...you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave. (10)The earth has forgotten her. (13)Each city receives its form from the desert it opposes; and so the camel driver and the sailor see Despina, a border city between two deserts. (15)Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city can begin to exist. (19)The one contains what is accepted as necessary when it is not yet so; the others, what is imagined as possible and, a moment later, is possible no longer. (28)There are more, but I tire. I think for a few aphorisms to illustrate an intellectual point this is a good place to go, but I was sad I did not love it as others seem to.I did, however, love the city (the city of Cecilia? Really?) that grew to encompass the goatherder. He recognized countryside and landmarks of vegetation but became lost in cities, still his goats remembered the grass after the suburbs spread. They recognised the grass on the traffic island. I never imagine Venice having extensive suburbs that blend seamlessly into the neighboring city eating up the country, so perhaps it is not entirely about Venice after all.",2015-06-04 05:37:07,2,en,2015-06-04 05:37:07,6,2015,0.00356,0.0001,0.0003,0.00011,0.0003,0.00022,729

jill,"This isn't really poetry, but I'm putting it on my poetry shelf anyway because I needed to process it like poetry to get anything out of it. And it's only travel in an imaginary sense, but I'm putting it on my travel shelf too, because it makes a lot of good points about travel, and I feel like it. Basically, it's an imaginary travelogue, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan about the cities that he (Polo) has visited in Khan's empire. Only, it's clear that maybe Marco Polo is just making this up as he goes along and the cities are really just metaphors for something else. You sort of get the feeling there's some serious opium use going on. You could probably just skim this book quickly and enjoy it for the gorgeous imagery and fantastical ideas without worrying about the overall structure. However, there is a pretty detailed if haphazard seeming structure to the cities, and I think this is definitely a book that rewards close reading. I took notes on all the cities as I went along, and I'm glad I did. Most of the cities are very vivid, but I got overwhelmed by the inundation of fantastical city after fantastical city and would not have been able to remember or sort out all the points he was making without jotting summaries down. Plus, he groups the cities in categories -- cities and memory, cities and signs, cities and desire, cities and eyes, cities and names, cities and the sky, trading cities, thin cities, cities and the dead, continuous cities, hidden cities -- but the categories are all mixed up together, in nine different sections of conversation. This is a good idea, because the shades of difference between the points he's making in two cities within a given category isn't always huge, so reading about all the memory cities in one go would be kind of tedious. Also, he makes similar points in different categories, so his points about, for instance, memory and signs, might both relate to ""reading"" a city. This overlap between categories is illustrated by mixing up the categories. Not all of the cities interested me. Some points Calvino was making seemed very obvious, and others obscure enough that I don't think my summaries were effective (because I don't think I processed the point he was trying to make). Also, his ideas for the cities can run together a bit, and themes are definitely repeated; two different sets of gods, for instance, or cities that are abandoned and rebuilt for various reasons, or cities with a twin. But I really liked some of the cities, and all of the descriptions were so short and detailed that even the ones I didn't like on a conceptual level were worth the couple paragraphs of reading. My least favorite parts were generally the interactions between Polo and Khan that began and ended each of the nine sections of cities. There were a few moments in those interactions that I found noteworthy, but overall I thought they were less vivid and more likely to be pretentiously unclear than the cities themselves. Those were the sections where I rolled my eyes and muttered ""opium"" under my breath.Most of the cities had feminine names, some of them obviously just women's names like Esmeralda or Phyllis, which made me think about ways Calvino could have made similar points with descriptions of imaginary people instead of cities. Obviously, lots of his points about travel and society might not have translated into a book of people, but I think a similarly fantastical book of ""Invisible People"" could be interesting, with different categories of points to be made.Some of my favorite cities: Maurilia, one of the memory cities, which is both a city and its postcards; Fedora, one of the desire cities, which contains a building full of globes with miniature versions of all the possible futures imagined for it; Chloe, one of the trading cities, where no one ever greets each other so that all interactions are imagined and no real interactions can get in the way of the ""carosel of fantasies;"" and Irene, one of the names cities, which ""is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes."" Like I said, I took a lot of notes on this book so I still have my homemade Cliff Notes version, but I think I'll probably get my own copy at some point. It's something I'll want to revisit.",2009-02-13 04:10:51,4,en,2009-02-13 04:10:51,2,2009,0.00066,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,752

Murat Nuri,"Today, all over the world we are told to stay at home and self-isolate. Cities are in-lockdown, streets are abandoned. When I was reading the last pages of ""Invisible Cities"", the events were still unfolding. Every day governments were issuing new orders to combat the virus: shelter-in-place, curfew, quarantine of entire cities. On the Internet photos were circulating of Paris, New-York and Rome deserted, their famous touristy sites visited now by only birds and some police. In Baku, in my city of winds, similarly affected by the pandemic, this book still allows me to leave the confines of my room and discover cities. Places. Ideas. I devour the words of Marco Polo, rushing through the yet unvisited invisible cities and when I finish I have a sweet taste in my mouth. Of the nostalgia of all the cities I travelled to, and of my own which now is as out of reach as any other. I suggest to everyone who is a traveller, who even once wanted to escape the limits of their town or village, and who now is stuck at home, to read this book, at least some chapters of it, as the book is not continuous. I hate to call books as a ""self-help"", but this one is for tourists. Whether you have ever been to another city or you are an optimist and plan to do it in the near future, this book will give you a novel perspective on how to visit and see an urban environment. Cities tell stories through their people, through the way their streets lead to the main avenue, through the side of a river on which its houses are built. This book combines these stories, mixes them and create cities that are ""invisible"" to an ordinary eye. That is why it does not matter whether these stories belong to only one city (perhaps Venice) or to different cities at different times. Anyhow, one part of these stories will concern any city built by humans, and you will see that story as you visit your dream city once this terror comes to an end, or revisit it in your memories, physically isolated.",2020-04-03 06:18:17,4,en,2020-04-03 06:18:17,4,2020,0.00168,0.00011,0.0002,0.00013,0.00021,0.00018,361

Ipshita Sengupta,"""Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” ― Italo Calvino, 'Invisible Cities'In Italo Calvino's 'Invisible Cities' Marco Polo narrates the stories of his expeditions to Kublai Khan. Vibrant and multifarious, his account shifts from being fantastical to distopian. The emperor however, constantly interrogates the traveller about his cities, discovering in course of their conversation that the cities being described are all the same—Venice.I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""'Invisible Cities' is a kind of book that reveals itself through multiple readings. As soon as you finish reading it, you long to read it again—looking for a new city to fall in love with. Marco Polo's cities, wrapped in a faint dreamlike spell, exudes a hint of nostalgia. It's a book that couldn't have been written any differently. Highly recommended!",2018-11-18 14:25:51,4,en,2018-11-18 14:25:51,11,2018,0.00078,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,249

Vivian,"So unique and really just one of the most impressive feats of imagination I've encountered in a while. I loved the way the book doubled, tripled, quadrupled back on itself, revisiting the same themes in slightly different variations-- or maybe, as Polo says, just describing the same thing over and over and over again in infinitely different ways. Beautiful language, melancholy, and equally enamored with cities (and, by extension/proxy, humankind) as appalled by them. I found myself thinking of my own relationship to real cities I love, but also of course thinking of all the more abstract ideas that each city really stands in for. There were moments, especially about midway through, when I felt the premise was getting a bit repetitive and wondered whether there'd be more coming structurally, but ultimately the enjoyment of reading it -- and the little surprises that would pop up along the way -- made it special enough to round up to 5.",2021-10-04 10:19:03,5,en,2021-10-04 10:19:03,10,2021,0.00058,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,159

Cali,"In just one chapter of Calvino, there's enough raw imagination to spin a dozen novels. His nuggets of wisdom and curiousity are brilliant - it almost doesn't matter what the rest of the book is about.

Geoffrey Hagberg,"What is it: Marco Polo describing to Kublai Khan the cities of the Khan's empire, but the descriptions are all prose poems and the cities are all metaphors.Why I love it: I've read three books this year that left me breathless: the first, David Ferry's translation of The Aeneid; the second, Anne Carson's translations of Sappho; the third, the collected cities of Kublai Khan. Or, perhaps, Polo's cities. Or, maybe most accurately, Calvino's cities.I don't want to spoil much here, because part of the breathless reading experience for me was the novelty of this text. Each city is unlike the rest. The way these cities are described warps over the course of the text, beginning almost matter-of-factly but verging into surreal and impossible. And the dialogue between Polo and the Khan takes surprisingly poignant turns. But without spoiling too much (hopefully), it's worth calling out two features of Invisible Cities: its images and its structure.Images are the majority of Invisible Cities. This is at least partly why the book is described as a collection of prose poems. Like poetry, the meaning of Polo's descriptions comes not from what is described but from the images Calvino uses in the description. I rarely read imaginatively--that is, I rarely feel like I need to or want to imagine anything when reading a text, because usually the text itself is sufficient--but Calvino writes of the Khan's cities so evocatively yet so evasively that I couldn't help but imagine. Imagination became a necessary tool to move from the described city to the communicated meaning, a necessary tool to look past what was said to understand why it was said.Those images, evocative and evasive as they are, could be frustrating to read without any framework or foundation, but Calvino assembles these descriptions of these cities with multiple layers of highly imposed order. The description of each city is labeled by theme--cities and memory, cities and signs, cities and names, etc.--the label providing just a little guidance for the imagination. The cities are counted and grouped--alternating among five themes at a time, progressing through five cities in each theme, adding new themes where a prior theme ends--the grouping providing a rhythm and pace for the reading experience. The groups are interrupted by the framing conversation between Kublai and his guest. Polo and his host provide the most explicitly philosophical content of the text but also the most particularly human moments.The result of these two features, the images and the structure, is a collection of small texts assembled by complex, artificial relationships in such a way as to reveal the surprisingly simple, natural meaning of the larger whole. Is it spoiling too much if I point out that cities are collections of small places assembled by complex, artifical relationships in such a way as to reveal the surprisingly simple, natural conditions of human systems?You might also like: I think Building Stories is doing something similar to Invisible Cities, but instead of prose poems it's a multi-format graphic novel, instead of cities it's buildings, and instead of human systems it's one individual's story. So maybe not similar at all? Try it anyway.",2020-07-17 09:27:38,5,en,2020-07-17 09:27:38,7,2020,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,523

Holly Fairall (birdbrainbooks),"I abandoned this one, it just wasn’t for me.

I’ve read some people saying you have to read each passage multiple times to truly absorb the themes etc. but frankly I don’t have the time or drive to do that here.

Veronika,"I haven't yet decided on a final rating for ""Invisible Cities"" but in the meantime, it was a ★★★☆☆ read for me. I finished it within a day for a book club &amp; once again, just like in the case of one of my recent reads, Jenny Odell's ""How To Do Nothing"", I was tricked into thinking that I'd be able to read it really quickly due to its length (just about 170 pages). What came out as a conclusion of our group discussion, is that you need to give this book the space &amp; the time to develop within your mind (the majority of us actually having rushed through it instead). I also had my opinion once again confirmed that books read on screens (which is the way I had to do it for this one) simply don't stick as much with you as paper books. I didn't manage to get the printed copy in time but I'm looking forward to re-reading it once I receive it by post (&amp; going back to this review to see whether I would change its rating).The story consists of 55 descriptions of fictitious ""cities"" in the framework of Marco Polo describing them to the emperor of China. Each of them is between 1 &amp; max 4 pages long, so it pretty much turns the book into a collection of super short stories. What I really appreciated about it, is the fact that it seems it will depend a LOT from reader to reader of what you will take away from the stories.
  ""It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear."" (p. 135)
There are some that I connected with strongly &amp; others that didn't speak to me at all. One that I really enjoyed was Adelma (each of the cities has an imaginary name), reminding me of how I seem to encounter parallel equivalents of people in different cities.
  ""You reach a moment in life when, [...] the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask."" (p. 95)
Or Leonia, which was an artistic description of our throw-away society &amp; how things are exchanged for something new on a daily basis, creating a wall of trash around each city. What I couldn't stop myself from throughout the entire reading experience, was imaging the stories as paintings. Each ""city"" is described in such a visual way that to me they gave off a vibe of Dali's surrealist work.
  ""The lake's surface was barely wrinkled; the copper reflection of the ancient palace of Sung was shattered into sparkling glints like floating leaves."" (p. 86)
The writing is very philosophical &amp; metaphorical, drawing parallels to modern-day life, emotions, inter-personal relations &amp; so much more. It feels very airy &amp; dreamy, the writer manages to establish a certain ethereal flow &amp; lightness to the words. It mostly follows one main theme, which is the duality of things: Life only existing because there is death, or positivity only existing because there is negativity. ""Invisible Cities"" is not a book I would have normally picked up, so I'm grateful for this book club pick for broadening my horizon once again!",2020-05-06 00:02:21,3,en,2020-05-06 00:02:21,5,2020,0.00134,0.0001,0.00022,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,547
Prongs,"I’m so glad that I picked what might possible be the most difficult book I have ever reviewed as a way to ease myself back into the literary world. As far as ‘novel’ idea’s go… Italo Calvino has certainty left his imprint on the literary mold, combining the best elements of prose and freeverse in his ‘novel’ Invisible Cities.The story reads as a back-and-forth between the explorer Marco Polo and the great Mongol ruler Kubali Khan. On his brief visits, Marco Polo describes to the great emperor the many cities that he has come across on his expeditions, with the brief descriptions making up the majority of the novel. As neither men speak the same language, it is possibly important to question exactly who’s account we are reading. Is it the exact depiction given by the romanticized Polo or just the mystifying translations understood by Khan. Either way, as the two great but divergent minds of their time sit in the gardens of a palace, the men seem to find a common ground in the beauty of the multitudes that can only exist in foreign lands.In simplest terms, Invisible Cities is a story about cities. In the most complicated it’s still a story about cities. However, in the brief 165 pages, Calvino manages to make a story about cities unfold and develop into a complex blueprint for the potential of imagination. With each new city we develop a new passage or corridor of possibilities that before might have been unimaginable. I can only compare his writing to an M.C. Escher painting for the world as a whole, beautiful and bewildering.Polo describes Valdra, built on a lake where when arriving you see two cities, and where nothing exists or happens in one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat in it’s reflection. He takes us through Andria, built so artfully that its every street follows a planet’s orbit, and the buildings and the places of community life repeat the order of the constellations. With his seductive prose, Calvino manages to bring the reader back to a time before Google Maps and Tom Toms, when the mysteries of the world seemed so inexplicable yet tangible. I had to stop every so many pages to sit and attempt to draw out what I was imagining, and I highly suggest you all try the same.While the cities described by Polo are what gives this read it’s grasp in reality, it is the representation of cities as elements of human nature that make me want to shake Calvino and say ‘HOW ARE YOU SODAMN GOOD?!’ It becomes clear after the first few chapters, we are not only getting the imagery of distant cities, but of human conditions that feel as close as your own hometown. The invisible cities could be your own town, your backyard, it could be yourself.If you are looking for a short but highly impactful read, this book could not come more highly recommended. Read it. Then read it again. Then spend an afternoon doing nothing at all but imagining an Invisible Cities of your own. You might be surprised by how many you already know.",2010-12-21 01:23:40,5,en,2010-12-21 01:23:40,12,2010,0.00075,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,525
NED-DAP SC,"by Faryal SiddiquiItalo Calvino's Invisible Cities might be labelled a travelogue. It was, in fact, the traveller in me that first fell under its spell, though, the places Calvino describes don't exist on any map. Technically, this is a novel, a work of fiction, but one without any definite storyline. It consists of a sequence of imaginary dialogues between a young Venetian traveller Marco Polo and an aging Tartar emperor Kublai Khan, where neither of them understand one another's language at all, but come to understand each other through the colour of Polo's imagination. In the course of these discussions, the young Polo describes a series of metropolises he has seen journeying to the far reaches of Khan’s vast empire. Each short chapter describes a different city, 55 in all arranged in 11 groups.""Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions, but the emperor of the Tartars does continue listening to the young Venetian with greater attention and curiosity than he shows any other messenger or explorer of his""; so begins Calvino's compilation of fragmented urban imageries. Polo tells the Khan about Hypatia, a city of beautiful blue lagoons but where ""crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks""; Armilla, which ""has nothing that makes it seem a city, except the water pipes that rise vertically where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors should be""; the spider-web city of Octavia, whose residents live suspended over an abyss, supported by a net they know won't last long; and other marvellous cities. It may be that he is creating them all out of his imagination, or perhaps he is recreating details of his native Venice over and over again, or perhaps he is simply recounting some of the countless possible forms a city might take.At some point, you realize that Calvino is not talking about cities at all; not in the way we normally think of the word. His cities are constructed not of steel and concrete but of ideas. Each city represents a thought, an experiment, and an expression of some deeper sentiment or, as Polo tells Khan at one point, ""You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.""This is a slim book, but not the kind you devour in one sitting. I find myself pausing every two or three pages to process what I have just read, not because Calvino's writing is difficult to penetrate, but simply because of the fact that he packs so much into each sentence; there is so much there. It is best, I think, to read Invisible Cities like a traveller - slowly, luxuriously, as if you have all the time in the world.One of the cities described in the book ends with a warning, “You leave Tamara without having discovered it”; so it is with Invisible Cities. This is precisely what keeps drawing you back to this strange and wonderful book.",2014-10-15 20:56:51,5,en,2014-10-15 20:56:51,10,2014,0.00068,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,512

Steve,"I chose this book based on a recommendation, in some way, given by Jacob Geller. I had just finished Disco Elysium and went back to rewatch his essay on the game. In it, he quoted and deciphered it, even having portions of the book narrated in italian. Playing Disco Elysium, it was hard to really give a concrete reality to the game because of how many voices in your head were going at once, how many observations were being stacked and lobbed at you, handed to you intimately, hail mary’d to you in a screaming voice. This book, as it was described, felt similar. Before I began to read it, it felt like it was going to be a scrap book, a collection of fictional tellings of fictional cities between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, and there would be no way to tell what was up, what was West, etc.The beauty of this book is that these really do feel like dreamcities, ancient and historical provinces that exist in the islands of Calvino’s mind’s eye. They feel like places he can only describe through hypnosis. He describes the look of these places by telling of the behaviors of its people. He gives you a description of the smells that drift from the windows, of the heights your neck will crane to see, of the singular townsfolk you will hold conversations with. And none of them exist. None of them can ever be visited, whether in the 1970s, or the 13th century, or in 2022. These places do not exist, but also because they’ve been animated with perception, because they have been manifested, they do indeed exist. In corners of european walkways, on the shores of massive infrastructure, these places exist in glimpses the size of a polaroid.The book moves quickly. Each portion is broken up by city, each named with that of a woman’s name, and if you aren’t able to recreate one city, if one doesn’t sweep you into it, one will follow almost immediately. Like reading a book of poetry, I can almost recommend reading this one at a slower pace than you would a standard novel. This feels like it could have been broken up into index cards, read at lunch breaks, at red lights, between meetings. At every day where you would find a momentary pause, take a journey to a city that haunted the author’s mind, that only appeared in greater detail in the reflection off of his iris. Like poetry, some of this feels personal, some of this feels like he is sketching, some of this feels deeply important, some of this feels like he is lost in a love he is destined to destroy. Each of these cities not only gives us a slice of what’s there but also what isn’t, each of them is an inland empire of the wrinkled labyrinth of Calvino’s mind. A few years ago, when I was writing a few different things at once, none of which were coming together to any finale or climax or progress, really, I started trying to inspire myself to write differently. So many of the things I was writing about was about how people were interacting and very little of it was happening in any organic space. I challenged myself to write about places and only places. To take a few songs that I heard at random and to write about what that song would look like as a place that hadn’t been touched by human hands in centuries. What would the earth (or whichever planet it existed within) say if we were to observe it as a creature of only perception? I ended up calling it ‘TERRAFORMING’, because when I sat down with these songs rolling in my headphones, I was letting my fingers tectonically construct these places out of nowhere, eroding or diseroding places out of the blinding white nothing. I wonder what inspired Calvino to populate the earth with these cities, with these places. What lines of conversation brought him to these civilizations of spice and women and cathedrals and barracks and far stretching ocean culture. What made him need these cities to be touched by the hand of God, to in a blink become fashioned from ether and verve and ink?Zora, Argia, Zaldreide, Adelma, Theodora, Eusapia, Valdrada, Octavia; these are my favorite cities, all for different reasons. Some of them for their reflections, some of them for their beauty, some of them for the way they attribute themselves towards the dead. Each of these places has never existed as a shore I can set my foot upon, but exist now and onward in their pulsing reverberation. For the page or two that Calvino has expressed about them, so forward has my mind lived within them for hours, for years, and populated them with attributes and histories that no other reader has. One day, can I as Marco Polo talk to another reader as Kublai Khan and then vice versa, describe these cities in extravagant detail, with population and experience that both sounds so familiar and alien to one another?In between this dreamlike and ephemeral itinerary are conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, ones that seem to take place in a veritable haze on the portico of one of Khan’s grand palaces or perhaps in an elegant drawing room with windows surrounding the entire space. They wax philosophic on their existence, on the actualization of Places, on the quivering and heaving empire, on their selves. There are times when Khan even seems intent on disproving these cities which Polo describes, wherein Marco will spin riddles resembling an echo without creationsound. These interactions might be my favorite element of the book, as some of their observations reach larger than just cities and empires, but can be applied to peasants’ moments, to past and future, to the minute glimpses of our own lives. There’s a casualness to them, a stripped down banter that feels like we are shading in the spaces between living bodies. There is lots of cool art to be found out there based on these Invisible Cities, even if not trying to recreate what he has described, at least inspired by the notion that places can be pulled and constructed, made whole and granite when yanked out of illusion. But my favorite art of them all is the cover of the copy of the book I picked up. On its front, the book is all white, and in a form of cursive along the top it says simply, “Calvino”. Below that, still in white, is imprinted a tiered sort of rectangle, with a single one-line-drawing of a lightly curved m, a seagull in flight that we could draw as children. And then along the bottom in the same cursive: “Invisible Cities.” This blankness, this open white possibility releases one’s mind from any preconceived notions about what any of these cities can be. It doesn’t give you a guide for the architecture or the style or the form that any of these places take. The bird can represent a freedom, a concept of open sea. But the whiteness, the oblivion, that gives our mind the true separation it needs to allow the words to craft the images in our mind.This book is tough to love, even tougher to “rate”. I think for the most part, I read through these cities in a daydream, captivated not by the words on the page, but the places that those words took me. I loved the pages as prompts, and I loved the way they made my imagination take me to a different time and space. There were a great deal of sentences, passages and words that were beautiful, but none that really stood in the same place as the locales that no one will ever see quite the same as I did in my mind’s eye.I would definitely recommend this book, especially for writers and daydreamers, for creatives who seek inspiration for the places that we know exist but don’t belong in books or on websites or social media pages. It’s for the people who still want to wonder what might be out there, for people who still romanticize the need for maps and a world that might be ever expanding. The dream that things are there to be found just beyond the crest of a hill or below the cliff of a dune that we need just a few more steps to go beyond. This book has promised a world that we will never a touch, has built entire cities, entire atlases from dust and promise, and without war, without death and without time has razed them all the same.",2022-07-13 01:38:05,3,en,2022-07-13 01:38:05,7,2022,0.00102,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.0002,0.00015,1450
March,"This is a very quick, on-the-go review of Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities, as I am about to return the book to the library, as, apparently, someone has reserved it, and I cannot renew my loan. Anyway, I am done reading it, after quite some time; and this would not sound so out of place if the book was not, in fact, just a little over 120 pages. When I first saw the thin volume, I thought, alright! give it a week, at most, and I’m done. For me, Invisible Cities was a particularly slow read, and I did not quite “get” the book, regrettably. I was very keen to read a book by a modern Italian author, and Italo Calvino, “the most-translated contemporary Italian writer at the time of his death, and a noted contender for the Nobel Prize for Literature,” as the English Wikipedia describes him, was a somewhat natural choice.I’ve read many enthusiastic reviews of the book here, on goodreads, which partly sparked my interest in this particular work of Calvino’s. It is also the reason why I’m inclined to think that it’s somehow my own fault that I didn’t quite enjoy the book as much as I should have, I guess – perhaps I somehow didn’t read closely enough or didn’t do more research, or am not too much at home with semiotics and symbolism and stuff to fully appreciate it.Granted, I completely give it to Calvino that he has one hell of an imagination – to give descriptions of tens of different cities, one more odd, more twisted, and more idiosyncratic than the other, is an incredible achievement. Add to that the fact that these are all “imaginary cities” (although, of course, they all refer to/ describe one single city – Venice – which Calvino makes explicit at some point in the book), and you cannot fail to see Calvino’s enviably rich imagination. When I found out about this book, I thought that reading it would be sort of like a nice getaway to some faraway, beautiful, exciting places. Like a trip, if you will. Well, it didn’t feel like that. A lot about Calvino's cities is laden with symbolism – these are not so much places or cities, as spaces of the mind, strange symbols of social constructions or habits that reflect our living together. It’s a book about travelling, in all the senses of the word, about memories, attachments, the names we have for things as a function of these two, the visible and the hidden, the outside and the inside, the Self and the Other and the communication between the two; the titles of the chapters themselves are indicative (Cities &amp; Memory, Continuous Cities, Hidden Cities). And even though it was all a bit too veiled for my taste, I did marvel at Calvino’s rich and refreshing originality, and the wonderful bits like the quote below.Kublai asks Marco, ‘When you return to the West, will you repeat to your people the same tales you tell me?’Í speak and speak,’ Marco says, ‘but the listener retains only the words he is expecting…It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.’",2011-11-19 23:25:26,3,en,2011-11-19 23:25:26,11,2011,0.0008,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,530
Alex,"I enjoyed Invisible Cities, and I would recommend it, especially considering its brevity. If nothing else, it is very pretty writing with many beautiful turns of phrase. One that caught my eye is in Cities and Signs 4 (page 47 in the Harvest/HBJ edition): “the alphabetical order of vanished alphabets.” Maybe you won’t find yourself impressed by this sort of intra-sentence twist–in which case, from my experience with Invisible Cities and The Nonexistent Knight, don’t read Italo Calvino!–but I am delighted by them. That being said, I was frustrated by this book. Where this comes from seems to be the fruits of a successful execution of one of the theses of the book: because a city is the medium for countless relationships, it can only be known asymptotically, and therefore expressing a city through the form the book adopts (travelogue/anthology of fairy tales) is one more order removed from the network that constitutes the city. If Kublai Khan can’t hope to know the hexes he plays his gambit on top of, how can we possibly hope to know them from dialogue? I know what the lack of intimate knowledge conveyed in the text means in regards to Calvino’s thoughts about what the city is, and yet I still find the brevity disappointing. There’s a sense in which we become exhausted with the names and the contours of cities while still learning nothing, and even though it is frustrating, this tactic could be taken even further! What if Marco Polo decides to try to really go deep into a city. Mapped out an elaborate promenade through a single city. We hear him regale us with the relationship between harbor and commercial district, between neighbors and thin walls, human and pest. Once we feel like we’re finally getting the grasp of a place, the coup de grâce arrives. We know but a sliver of this city. We feel completely exhausted. We couldn’t possibly know this single city, and just think of how many cities Marco has told us about over the past month! That being said, I am impressed by how structured the book is, and my idea would put that structure all out of whack. My intention with this experiment was just to see if the ideas have been exhausted by this work, and I think not! It’s certainly a feat, but I would not say that it’s the end of the study of spaces in literature. 	Speaking of exhaustion, there’s a list that takes your mind for a run (p.136-137, starting and ending with “For other cities he falls back on descriptions handed down by word of mouth…and that every place can be reached from other places, by the most various roads and routes, by those who ride, or drive or row, or fly.”) This was the one for me that made me really realize that one of the methods being implemented here (I’d argue successfully) to describe and transport an audience is through difference, repetition, and juxtaposition. Maybe it doesn’t sound so profound, but it’s a really simple and effective technique! I find a lot of similarities here to John Ashbery’s “Into the Dusk-Charged Air.” Sometimes the old addages really do work: Keep it simple, stupid!	This is Calvino though, there’s a twist just around the corner, well, the next paragraph (hey, he went from twists within sentences to twists between paragraphs! Is that another one of his twists?). Quoting Marco Polo:“Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name.""Maybe a contradiction is arising. Or, maybe we can arrive at an understanding of form not as an eternal substance/category, but as a process to discover, emergent, evasive not because it resists discovery, but because it is always transforming. Transforming with each set member it encompasses and transforming as it responds to essays at its discovery. Pliable but not trappable. 	Now for a case study: Trading Cities 3. Through difference, constancy. I’m not sure about this philosophy, but I do find difference to be a very clear lens to look at our own situation through. How is your lot cast? Who picks the roles that last in perpetuity? Why not get up and shake things around? That’s what we can test with the city Eutropia. “On the day when Eutropia’s inhabitants feel the grip of weariness and no one can bear any longer his job, his relatives, his house and his life, debts, the people he must greet or who greet him, then the whole citizenry decides to move to the next city, which is there waiting for them, empty and good as new…” (p.64)There are a lot of intentional cities and cities that could only exist through intense planning in Invisible Cities, but this one reminded me a lot of the concept of infra-materialism in the video game Disco Elysium. In the communist political vision quest of that game, you can learn about a substance called “plasm:” essentially the materialized form, or manifestation, of class consciousness. Infra-materialist theorists believe that if a society reaches a high enough level of class consciousness, plasm (again, this is basically psionic mind powers) can affect the material world. Eutropia basically posits the same scenario, a completely post-political world, so advanced that planning is not even needed. The medium that social relationships live in is no longer the city, it is the consciousness, the plasm, of its residents. This is not the withering away of the state that Engels imagined communism would emerge from; this is the withering away of all impasses between humans. Can we even call Eutropians human? This is no longer a social species.A note not on content but on writing technique (though the passage itself has merits on being very pretty). The dialogue between Polo &amp; Khan about Venice (p.87) ends with the following sequence: Khan speaks, the lake is described, placid, only partially disturbed, Polo speaks. This punctuation of nature, quiet reflection, is enormous. Not only does the reader get a pause to digest Khan’s request and to anticipate Polo’s retort (which we correctly guess will be cryptic, but intimate and touching), we see the force of this dialogue perturb the surroundings. Though these are tales to entertain and inform, the city is profound in its fomenting of relationships between ourselves and the spaces we occupy, and how spaces transform us, even if it is the reverse that is typically more easily observable.I’d like to end on an extended passage. It’s about the city as the water infrastructure snaking within a boundary on a municipal map, and a medium of social relationship. It is the agora and it is every conversation taking place in the agora. “Something rungs among them, an exchange of glances like lines that connect one figure with another and draw arrows, stars, triangles, until all the combinations are used up in a moment…And thus, when some people happen to find themselves together, taking shelter from the rain under an arcade, or crowding beneath an awning of the bazaar, or stopping to listen to the band in the square, meetings, seductions, copulations, orgies are consummated among them without a word exchanged, without a finger touching anything, almost without an eye raised.” (p.51)Addendum: In July of 2022, I wrote a poem entitled “Tanka with the glasses Arthur Osver lent me.” I edited it for a final draft on October 28, 2022. I started reading Invisible Cities on November 7th of 2022. I point this out because in my poem, I have the following line: “Scaffold-embraced observing.” In Cities &amp; The Sky 3, there is a passage: “...scaffoldings that embrace other scaffoldings…” It’s an interesting convergence but it’s independent on my end. I point it out because I think it’s a nice similarity in how I share how to read the city with the author.",2022-11-13 13:52:45,0,en,2022-11-13 13:52:45,11,2022,0.0008,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,1332
chris,"""In the lives of emperors there is a moment which follows pride in the boundless extension of the territories we have conquered, and the melancholy and relief of knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding them. There is a sense of emptiness that comes over us at evening, with the odor of the elephants after the rain and the sandalwood ashes growing cold in the braziers, a dizziness that makes rivers and mountains tremble in the fallow curves of the planispheres where they are portrayed, and rolls up, one after the other, the despatches announcing to us the collapse of the last enemy troops, from defeat to defeat, and flakes the wax of the seals of obscure kings who beseech our armies' protection, offering in exchange annual tributes of precious metals, tanned hides, and tortoise shell. It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the stem of all wonders, is an endless, formless rain, that corruption's gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.

Lee,"You can read this story by the Italian fabulist Calvino on two different levels. Ostensibly a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in which the adventurer describes 55 cities he has visited in the empire to the emperor, you can try to focus on the unique physical aspect of each city as described. This is interesting and has led to many different artists creating visual interpretations of the cities as described in the book. But that's not really what the book is about.Each description of a city, 1-3 pages long each, takes one facet of the human experience and makes it the defining feature of that city. In Chloe, everyone is a stranger, no one ever greets anyone with recognition, and at each encounter with another person, one imagines a thousand different possibilities unfolding before quickly looking away. Perenthia was laid out in design to reflect the perfection of the firmament, to create heaven and utopia on earth, but gives birth to monsters. Octavia is suspended from a net stretched across a void between two huge mountains, buildings held up by being tied to the net above; life is less uncertain in Octavia, as inhabitants know the net will last only so long. Valdrada was built above a reflective lake, so that nothing that happens in the above ground Valdrada does not also happen in the Valdrada of the lake, and the inhabitants are so aware of their copied image that they take no action without taking special care of how that copied image will look (this book was published in 1972, well before Instagram!).Halfway through the book, Polo tells Kublai Khan that in describing each city he is really describing his home city of Venice, describing some aspect of that city. But he is also describing some aspect of humanity in each description of a city. As Kublai Khan tells him in one of the dialogues that are placed between descriptions of cities, ""I hear, from your voice, the invisible reasons which make cities live, through which perhaps, once dead, they will come to life again."" Polo replies, ""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name.""Humanity, in other words, is more similar than the differences suggested by maps and human constructions. More durable as well. Travelogues are interesting but what they tend to describe is not lasting. ""Only in Marco Polo's accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites' gnawing.""It's a hopeful vision.",2020-05-12 05:17:44,4,en,2020-05-12 05:17:44,5,2020,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,461
William Burr,"This book is slow, and reads more like a poem than a novel. Was looking forward to finishing it and being on to the next, and yet, I think it will stay with me. Dozens of vignettes describing cities visited by Marco Polo, which he describes to the emperor Kublai Khan, who wishes to know more about his empire. The cities are imaginary and fantastical. One is underground, and the residents move through the dirt. In another, none of the city’s inhabitants know each other. In another, the idea that the inhabitants have of their city is completely different from the reality. One city can only be seen from a distance, at dusk.At one point Kublai Khan doubts that Marco Polo has ever travelled, and wonders if he has in fact been in the emperor’s garden the whole time. Then the Khan wonders if either of them is truly in the garden, or whether the emperor is actually out waging battles, and Marco Polo, travelling. The book is an imaginary, cloudy world of cities that have each their own magical, mysterious properties.This hazy, blurred, impossible world described by Calvino is almost familiar. Who’s to say that there aren’t cities like this in parallel universes, who’s to say that we don’t flit back and forth from one city to another in different lifetimes. O,r speaking metaphorically, who’s to say that we aren’t all in different “cities” at different times, as in, in different ways of thinking - whether we are longing for the ideal city, while living in the flawed one, as the residents of one do, or whether we are ignoring everyone around us, as they do in another. I love the ending of the book. The emperor and Marco Polo are talking about hell. The emperor says life is pointless if it leads eventually to a “hell city.” Marco Polo answers that if hell exists, it is in the sphere of the living. There are two ways not to suffer from it, he says: either accept hell so thoroughly that you become a part of it, to the point that you no longer realize it is hell. The other way requires constant learning and attention : to find out what, in the midst of hell, is not hell, and then to make more and more space for that which is not hell.It is such a mysterious ending , and yet seems to tie the book together perfectly. The inhabitants of all of these cities, with their ridiculous habits and obsessions, go about their lives thinking that these hang ups are normal. It is Marco Polo, the observer, the traveller, who can truly see what each one is, mysterious and strange. That which is not hell exists perhaps in this clear-sightedness.The book was slow but I’m glad I read it.",2016-05-11 09:51:03,3,en,2016-05-11 09:51:03,5,2016,0.00475,0.00011,0.00035,0.00016,0.00035,0.00024,470

This little book was such a good read. the beautiful portrayal of the invisible cities in words still stuck in my head after a month.This book is hard to explain what it is about, because it does not have a specific genre. It's not a collection of short stories, nor is it a memoir. It's just, simply put, a collection of descriptions of the impossible, non-existing cities that the explorer, Marco Polo, claimed he visited when he traveled to Venice. In less than 100 pages, this book was able to make me fall in love with its lyrical writing. I'm a huge plot seeker- I usually choose to read books that lead to something, a story that has points, the up-downs, arrangements. This book is the opposite and still, I was captivated. such such beautiful writing, especially on the description of the cities! (also it made me miss traveling huhu)Honestly I don't know how to give a proper review to this book. Just read it and you'll know.

Adam,"Unconventional writing, full of beautiful images. More poetry than prose at times. And like most poetry, I didn't understand it. The descriptions of the cities were wonderful in and of themselves, but I became annoyed with trying to decipher the metaphors and second meanings. I was attracted to the book because I heard it presented unique forms of storytelling about cities. And I've bookshelved this in the “urbanism” section. But really, the stories are often means to other ends, like a meditation on the nature of memory or imagination. What those meanings are, I'm afraid, I can't say I grasped. The book alternates between the narrator describing the interaction between Marco Polo's storytelling of his travels to the emperor and Polo's stories themselves. A sort of meta theme that is the reflection on the act of reflecting on travels and experiences of the city. Marco Polo is at times uneasy with this task, fearing that the images of cities in his memory become erased upon his verbal description of them. Again, kind of neat, but not really sure what meaning is to be gleamed from this. At it's worst, some of Calvino's writing reads like dorm room pot-induced faux-philosophical offerings: Does that city exist because it's in my memory, or does my memory exist because of that city? You know, that kind of stuff. Another theme is the emperor's alienation from his own empire. An emptiness grows within him, even as his empire grows outside of him. What is he lacking? Perhaps experience itself—he relies on the stories told, remembered, interpreted by the traveler. It seems that this presents an interesting metaphor, but again, for what, I'm not sure.The most enjoyable part is when the writing turns into almost Shel Silverstein or Dr. Seus-like absurdity: “in every pore of the stone there are invisile hordes, jammed on the funnel-sides as in the stands of a stadium, and since with each generation Laudomia's descendants are multiplied, every funnel contains hundreds of other funnels each with millions of persons who are to be born, thrusting their necks out and opening their mouths to escape suffocation” (142).Like Homer Simpson watching a Twin Peaks episode, I shake my head and exclaim, “Brilliant! ... I have absolutely no idea what’s going on.”",2009-04-11 15:33:40,3,en,2009-04-11 15:33:40,4,2009,0.00203,0.0001,0.00026,0.00012,0.00022,0.00017,377
Jacob de Lore,"6/10WHAT I LIKEDIn terms of style, this book is incredible. It has these incredibly poetic descriptions of such rich and varied cities, while at the same time having this brilliantly cascading structure which manages to be interesting without being overly pretentious. I think an obvious problem that often to come up with a book like this is that having these very defined sections in a novel might tend to lend themselves to comparison with each other (with the consensus being that one section is clearly better than the other, etc.). However, Calvino manages to maintain an incredible degree of consistency and intrigue throughout his various section, with each chapter, without fail, managing to feel like one of Donne's sonnets set in a surrealist wonderland. I usually take issue with texts that avoid traditional storytelling by deciding to be more structurally experimental, but this novel – though challenging to get through at times – was a real delight to read. I think it's due to the fact that the novel is structured so well: taking appropriate times to pause for narrative developments between Polo and Khan, amongst short enamouring explorations of a collection of truly weird and wonderful cities.WHAT I DISLIKEDThough I really adored the structure of this book once I had settled into it, I felt like this structure serves as a blessing at the same time as it does a curse. I feel like the opening of the book doesn't leave enough time for the audience to become grounded in the overarching world and the characters of the novel. The initial interactions between Khan and Polo span a couple of pages (if even that) before it throws you into these (at the time) seemingly arbitrary descriptions of a bunch of weird cities. Despite falling into rhythm with its style after a while, I felt like the 'rushed' nature of the opening really detracted from some truly great moments that happened within it. To me, it really just gave off the sense that Calvino was prioritising adhering to his structural games, rather than giving his readers a chance to catch on with what was happening. But I honestly feel like Calvino could have done nothing about this issue because such a brief opening is ultimately hardcoded into the unfolding structure of the text.",2020-01-20 19:09:30,3,en,2020-01-20 19:09:30,1,2020,0.0007,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,383
Andrew Nguyen,"Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.I have never read a book as unique as Invisible Cities. Written as a series of prose poems, Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan about fictional cities in his vast empire. The cities never existed. Cities, created by the hand of man, reflect the desires and dreams of humans. The descriptions of the cities are actually poems about time, death, relationships, desires, memories, heaven, hell and everything in between. Each section also begins and ends with a third-person narration of conversations between Polo and Khan which set the tone for the cities described in that section.I don't read a lot of poetry and I don't know how to review it, but I like this book. I like the poem about Despina, a city that reflect's man's desires for the things he doesn't have. My other favorite is Zobeide, an ugly city that is designed by men who want to capture the woman they have fallen for- the city is only beautiful to them.",2018-05-12 06:17:45,4,en,2018-05-12 06:17:45,5,2018,0.00075,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,202
Ella Dixon,"I decided to read this because I loved the cover. One time I was in an elevator at work and some old guy asked me what it was about and if I liked it. I was like, yeah. It’s great. And he was like I’m going to read it just because you love it. And I was thinking to myself, wow maybe it’s time for me to start taking the stairs up to the 12th floor of my building.Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are besties and love to tell each other stories about the world in a garden where they’re protected from the horrors of actually living in them. The cities resemble those in the outside world to varying degrees, each one more fantastical than the last. Some of the cities made me think about the impact of religion on the ways that we live, others reminded me of the reactions that we have to the ways others live and how even perception of others can form the basis for a way of life, can trickle down into the ways that we build the environment around us. Very urban planning core if you ask me. This novel is about more than that, though. It’s about the ivory towers from which the powerful leaders of the world view what happens in their kingdoms. The sharp angle of viewing the world from above warps reality. Living so far from this reality can also distort the priorities of the citizens. Or these priorities can be blatantly ignored by those with the power to make decisions on their behalf. It’s scary to think about people as detached and greedy choosing how people live, especially when their kingdom encompasses such a large magnitude of people. This was a really quick read about the dangers of unharnessed power, detached wealth, blind greed, and the ways that all of these nebulous forces can act on the environment and shape the people who live there. I want to spend some more time with this one next year because I feel like there was a lot that I didn’t have time to really sit with and process.

hannah,Absolutely amazing -- a love letter to imagination. Invisible Cities is unlike any other book I've read both in format and content.

Orton Family Foundation,"Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities published in 1972 got me thinking about how we imagine the places in which we live, how the imagined places differ from the actual places, and the ways in which the physical structure of a place reflects the minds and desires of the people living there—and vice versa. Cities, in Calvino's dreamlike tale, are like living, breathing organisms. They are built as much of the emotions and thoughts inspired when walking through them as they are of bricks and mortar. Here's a passage from a chapter entitled ""Continuous Cities"":The city of Leonia refashions itself every day: every morning the people wake between fresh sheets, wash with just-unwrapped cakes of soap, wear brand-new clothing, take from the latest model refrigerator still unopened tins, listening to the last-minute jingles from the most up-to-date radio.On the sidewalks, encased in spotless plastic bags, the remains of yesterday's Leonia await the garbage truck... It is not so much by the things that each day are manufactured, sold, bought that you can measure Leonia's opulence, but rather by the things that each day are thrown out to make room for the new. So you begin to wonder if Leonia's true passion is really, as they say, the enjoyment of new and different things, and not, instead, the joy of expelling, discarding, cleansing itself of a recurrent impurity.In our work with small cities and towns, the Foundation helps communities take a closer look at themselves in their efforts to identify the unique characteristics they would like to see sustained for generations to come. I wonder, if asked to write a profile of their home modeled after Calvino's stories, what kind of picture they would paint. Which of Calvino's cities would their home most resemble? The book got me thinking about how we perceive our places, how we function in them (or how places shape how we function), and how places really are the physical manifestation of a particular cross-section of humanity at a particular point in history.It's a great, thought-provoking read.",2009-09-16 01:05:21,0,en,2009-09-16 01:05:21,9,2009,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,338
Michael Scott,"A fractal book about a fractal city. You discover the fractal if you know how to look for it. Once you discover it, it's gone, for, like the city, the book is slowly evolving; it's the memory, the desire, the signs; then the desire, the signs, the memory; ultimately, the names, the dead, the sky.

Evie,"""The other ambassadors warn me of famines, extortions, conspiracies, or else they inform me of newly discovered turquoise mines, advantageous prices in marten furs, suggestions for supplying damascend blades. And you?"" the Great Khan asked Polo, ""you return from lands equally distant and you can tell me only the thoughts that come to a man who sits on his doorstep at evening to enjoy the cool air. What is the use, then, of all your traveling?"" -- p. 27Italo Calvino’s ponderous work titled “The Invisible Cities” is indubitably worthy of praise. This 165-page production is not one with an unravelling plot, but rather an assembly of fanciful descriptions of whimsical cities, peculiar scenery and sagacious, philosophical ideas. The recollection of these dreamlike tales of these fantastic cities is presented to Kublai Khan, Tartar emperor, by the blossoming Venetian traveler, Marco Polo, who is believed to have visited all of these cities himself. These cities are categorized accordingly: cities and memory, cities and desire, cities and designs, cities and the dead, cities and eyes, cities and signs and the like. Moreover, it appears that these cities, such as ""Despina,"" ""Anastasia,"" and ""Zora"" (to name a few), although “fantastic,” simultaneously do and don’t exist. What I mean by this is that although these cities cannot be geographically located on a map, allegorically, they represent overlaying concepts and themes, such as discovery, yearning, downfall, that are evidently prevalent in our modern-day societies. In addition, what I found intriguing and perhaps, even brilliant on Calvino’s part, is that each of these fictional cities is really all in all, the same one. Similarly, all of the elements distinctly featured in these individual, yet the same, cities co-occur in our society as well. On the whole, I found this work to be relatively easy to read through, quite interesting and rather psychedelic or mind-blowing. It was a pleasant read and I recommend it to all who enjoy reading books that expand the horizons of one’s mind!",2012-10-17 23:37:56,5,en,2012-10-17 23:37:56,10,2012,0.00071,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,330
Bryan,"In Raissa, life is not happy. People wring their hands as they walk in the streets, curse the crying children, lean on the railings over the river and press their fists to the temples. In the morning you wake from one bad dream and another begins. At the workbenches where, every moment, you hit your finger with a hammer or prick it with a needle, or over the columns of figures all awry in the ledgers of merchants and bankers, or at the rows of empty glasses on the zinc counters of the wineshops, the bent heads at least conceal the general grim gaze. Inside the houses it is worse, and you do not have to enter to learn this: in the summer the windows resound with quarrels and broken dishes.And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, ""Darling, let me dip into it,"" to a young serving maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at having painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow in the illumination of that page in the volume where the philosopher says: ""Also in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.""",2013-09-06 23:46:03,4,en,2013-09-06 23:46:03,9,2013,0.01013,0.00011,0.00038,0.00017,0.0006,0.00032,344
zhixin,"This is prose-poetry masquerading as a novel, a love letter to the form of civilisation most of us find ourselves in now.Each section is short, the length of a paragraph or two, painting a vignette of a different city filled with esoteric wonders: mazes of towers, alleys, and canals; assortments of pickpockets and lovers; clouds of desires and memories. <em>Invisible Cities</em> follows the format of a travelogue, of which traveller is Marco Polo; interspersed within the depictions are dialogues between Marco and the great emperor Kublai Khan which take on a meditative quality, a moment of contemplation as the beating heart of an empire takes counsel from an explorer of lands beyond his realm. Between the two there are mutual respect and a deep desire to decipher the core of the human experience, a pattern that replicates regardless of the myriad forms a city takes.Within its pages, despite the foreign architecture, we will find familiar the sense of wonder with our cities' exuberance, tempered with the same alienation, a kind of outsider's loneliness belonging both to the traveller <em>and </em>the city's inhabitants: the same quest within ourselves searching, aching for something we don't know but want. ""If on arriving at Trude I had not read the city's name written in big letters, I would have thought I was landing at the same airport from which I had taken off.""What are all the possible permutations of buildings and people we can find?

Winding like a spiral staircase across eleven themes, titled Memory, Desire, Signs, Thin, Trading, Eyes, Names, Dead, Sky, Continuous, and Hidden, the book provides plenty of fodder for introspection, for dreaming of fantastical lands and their light and shadows, and then forever finding aspects of our homes reflected in these reveries.",2020-02-06 22:09:28,4,en,2020-02-06 22:09:28,2,2020,0.0008,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,307
Rohan,"Invisible Cities unfolds as a series of short detail-rich descriptions of cities seen by Marco Polo during his travels, told to emperor Kublai Khan. The premise is that Khan wants Polo to describe his vast empire to him, since he feels disconnected from the lands that his armies have conquered and that his ministers rule over. The descriptions of cities (mostly 1 or 2 pages, at most 4) address philosophical issues about cities, about living in cities, about the relationship of people to the city they live in (and vice-versa), and often abstractly question what it means for a city to ""be"". Interspersed with these descriptions are third-person recountings of opium-fuelled discussions between the emperor and the traveller. Polo seems to be a philosopher dispensing counsel and wisdom to the restless Khan, leading him to gain perspective on his empire via anecdotes and metaphor. Somewhat early on in the book Polo confesses that in all his (literally) fantastic descriptions he is really talking about his home city of Venice. While there are no major plot points besides this early revelation, the descriptions of cities and the back-and-forth between Khan and Polo kept me hooked all throughout the rest of the book. This was chiefly because the descriptions of some of the cities reminded me of cities I have lived in or passed through in my own life, and also because many of these descriptions examine human nature in a very detached and laconic way. This is despite the fact that a sizeable number of the city descriptions in the book are quite surreal — and despite the fact that a couple of them mention technology developed hundreds of years after the protagonists lived (airplanes and radio). Calvino seemed to have understood well the school of thought that says that fantasy is at its best when it examines, satirises or mirrors the real world.",2020-09-05 19:47:14,5,en,2020-09-05 19:47:14,9,2020,0.00066,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,313
Meehad Jawwad,"""And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced,"" Kublai said. ""It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combination.""""I have also thought of a model city from which I deduce all the others,"" Marco answered. ""It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real.""This novella is written in the form of a loose conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, in which Khan inquires about Polo's travels and Polo provides an account of the cities he had visited. But behind this seemingly simplistic exchange, is a running deliberation on everything but the subject itself.The manner in which the conversation takes place, sometimes verbal sometimes not, the reader is pulled to reflect upon imagination, reality, communication, perception, and so on.Polo's cities, besides being masterfully crafted through expression, become a critique on culture, society, ritual, love, death, beauty, and so on.With both these elements combined together, the novella is a beautiful exploration of the human spirit, and deserves to be read again and again at different points in life.

Simon,"Behind the cryptic title lies a short novel about Marco Polo's travels to China. Most of it is narrated by a fictionalized Marco Polo in first person, but other chapters are written in third person and describe Polo's philosophical conversations with Kublai Khan.The descriptions of the cities and cultures Polo has allegedly visited are rather fanciful, occasionally downright surrealistic, but always thoroughly beautifully written. Calvino definitely shows a talent for creating strange yet convincing fictional medieval cultures that many ""proper"" fantasy novelists would ill for. The weird thing is that if you've read even short excerpts from actual medieval travelogues, you'll notice that they are just as utterly bonkers if not more so!Halfways through, Calvino starts going beyond pastiche of the medieval travelogue genre and starts examining its hows and whys. The cities become stranger and stranger, with more overt anachronisms if sparingly used, and the narrative begins to explore the psychology behind why a man would travel across half the world in an era where that is so difficult that a 20th century reader could not easily grasp it, as well as the role worldviews have in shaping the course of history.Everything I've just described likely makes ""Invisible Cities"" sound rather clunky, but it definitely isn't. Italo Calvino knew exactly how to keep the Jorge Luis Borges-style post-modernist thought experiments around to the exact levels of subtlety that they add to the stories told... instead of overpowering them and turning them more into commentaries on literature than, well, actual literature.

Lora Grigorova,"Invisible Cities: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...My first encounter with the brilliant Italo Calvino was If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler, a novel centered on the love of reading. Structured as the epic search for that novel’s ending, it takes the passionate reader towards more and more incompleted books. In that blistful atmosphere, Calvino places reading on a piedestal and disects what is it that we, readers, love so much about and what feelings it brings us.I should have known that Calvino is not the conventional author, who will digest the information for you and then present it neatly on a plate. No wondering, no brain activity. I should have also known that his novels are more about experience than about content. It is near to impossible to say what the novel was about and yet when I read it I felt it made perfect sence. Yet, with all of those expectations of Calvino, I wasn’t in the least prepared for what expected me in Invisible Cities.Framed as a conversation between Kublai Khan, one of the Great Khans of the Mongol Empire, and Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant traveler and explorer, Invisible Cities is a recollection of 55 incredible cities in the Khan’s vast empire. Having conquered many unknown lands, the Khan sends messengers to investigate his possessions and report back. Among these travellers, one stands out. The Venetian Marco Polo at the beginning doesn’t speak the Khan’s language, so he describes the cities with gestures, figures, and associations, leaving the details to the Khan’s imagination:“I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the lsitener retains only the words he is expecting.”Read more: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...",2012-08-14 18:48:46,4,en,2012-08-14 18:48:46,8,2012,0.0007,0.00012,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,270
Hamish,"A neat little book. He's jocking Borges pretty hard (even more than he jocked Nabokov in If on a winter's night...), but I'll give him a pass because it feels less like he's imitating and more like using him as a starting point for something new. And it captures the thing I liked most about Borges, the feeling that I'm reading something like a myth or a fairy tale, that is perfect in its internal consistency and logic but seems incredibly foreign and mysterious to our way of looking at the world. Like parables with unclear meanings and lessons. It grants you the joy of being a little uncertain, a little mystified.Invisible Cities is made up of 55 vignettes. Each vignette has a title (e.g. Continuous Cities, Cities and the Sky, etc.) followed by a number (each vignette type appears five times), and are further divided into nine larger sections, bookended by a conversation between our narrator (Marco Polo) and his boss (Kublai Khan). The repeating vignette titles and numbers are arranged in a careful, mathematical order. Each vignette feels almost like a prose poem, usually with a little twist at the end. Sometimes they worked for me, sometimes they didn't. But again, even when they didn't, part of the joy was feeling like I was grasping at something just out of my reach. I was constantly searching for the links between the vignettes in each section, and the links between each vignette and the other four that shared its title, and the links that they all shared with the overarching themes. Each of these little strands of meaning criss-cross each other, almost like a spider's web. And if I didn't get everything, I felt the promise that I would in future readings.

Margaryta,"""Invisible Cities"" was definitely worth the wait. Ever since I heard about it from a classmate a couple of years ago, I knew this was a book I would enjoy not only for the writing but also for what Calvino managed to do. The premise of Calvino's book is fairly simple: Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan about various cities he has seemingly traveled to, though after a while the Khan begins to suspect that Polo is probably lying. If you stick to just this premise that's listed on the back cover, then ""Invisible Cities"" can seem rather dull and uneventful, as the Khan doesn't fully confront Polo about the latter telling stories about one city: Venice. What Calvino does, instead, is create a narrative that is deceptive and layered, much like the cities Polo describes. It is easy to get lost in the beautiful, poetic language of each vignette and forget the conversation that Polo and the Khan have in the beginning of that particular section. Yet with some attention and mental mapping one finds that everything is, in fact, closely intertwined, that Calvino's writing is prophetic and thoughtful in a way that is relevant more than 40 years after the book was first published. ""Invisible Cities"" has made me want to go searching for academic discourses about the significance of the city names and the parallel threads and patterns that Calvino has created - there are 5 of each of the ""chapters"", for example - because there is so much happening but it is not overwhelming or in your face about it.

Shin,"this book reads like the kind one would discover in a magical ancient library of mysterious unauthored texts. there is a persistent surrealism, an out of this world quality in #InvisibleCities: it talks of nothing in particular but also everything at once.i have not read anything else that had this much air of disattachment to the material world and strong interconnected to that of the metaphysical one we create in our perceptions. with the city as a major metaphor #ItaloCalvino explores terrains of memory, death, our relationship with symbols, and other abstract yet very real mind figures. he has no interest in money, sex, gender, etc. it's all about the things we know so well at the back of our minds we find hard to talk about. i guess that's what makes it feel so timeless and universal.the language helps a lot too. the book switches from conversations between the emperor Kublai Khan and ""traveller"" Marco Polo, and Marco Polo's description of the cities which are vivid yet also painfully vague. the imagery is so unique, out-of-this-world, but then perfectly makes sense. it's good too the way it doesn't deny it's ""unreal-ness"". its admittance of lying makes it all the more truthful.my only peeves are perhaps that eventually the delivery gets repetitive (it's intentional though, so you'd bear with it just well enough. and it's just 165 pages), and then the way it uses women as another figurative device. women in Calvino's cities are either whores or passive wives, thankfully there weren’t as much described midway to the end. still it's a wonderful book. i think that's the most appropriate word for it. ""wonderful"". it's perfect in manner of it being exactly what it's meant to be. Italo Calvino is brilliant as heck.#bookstagram #bookreview",2021-07-17 11:59:07,5,en,2021-07-17 11:59:07,7,2021,0.0119,0.00017,0.00129,0.00019,0.00085,0.0005,294
Damian,"A book I had long been meaning to get to, Calvino's collection of city-portraits has Marco Polo telling of his many travels to the great Kublai Khan, emperor of the Mongols. The cities of Marco Polo's travels are surreal and whimsical, more dreamscapes then cityscapes, and as the tales multiply, we are led to understand that Polo is talking not so much about physical destinations, but of aspects of society and humankind at large (at least that's what I think it is).In some ways, the book might be compared to the more accessible Einstein's Dreams, in which a different mechanism for time is posited in each mini-chapter, and the resulting impact on people explored. Here, we read about Thin Cities and Trading Cities, Continuous Cities and Hidden Cities. We read about Cities and Names, Cities and Eyes, Cities and Desires. In some cases, we are left with definite portraits of a spatial place. In other cases, it is the residents' behaviors or beliefs that define the space. Yet others exist only in the realm of pure metaphor, and we are left wondering ""but what the hell does it even look like?""The book is a uniformly beautiful read, but as a rather literal reader, I feel that most of its metaphor went over my head. Maybe the book should just be approached as an intellectual puzzle (indeed, even the chapter progression is satisfying once it ""clicks""). I might be asking too much in looking for meaning from each chapter -- what you certainly get is vivid idea, or maybe even less specifically, a vivid question.I was planning to give it three stars, but I realize I have to give it four, because I'm still thinking about it, weeks after having finished it.",2009-07-22 11:30:04,4,en,2009-07-22 11:30:04,7,2009,0.00081,0.00012,0.00021,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,291

Tim,"Invisible Cities is a string of short stories, usually 1-2 pages long, each a small description of a different city with its own character and peculiar features. There are really only two characters in the book: Marco Pollo, the traveler who is usually the teller of the stories, the one who is describing, and Kublai Khan, who is usually listening or sometimes asks questions that frame a new series of stories.It's really a cool book-- each vignette follows a similar style but as you move through the book the stories slowly grow more complex. There's definitely a rhythm in the familiar patterns but each arrangement works to move you in a different way. Some stories talk about how a population remembers its dead or how the scientists have planned the city to resemble the stars or how one city builds a tower to escape the effects of aging. The subjects and themes are very fable-like in a way-- what becomes interesting is really how each piece works as a metaphor and can be part of something larger.That said, I really, really wish I hadn't read a review of this book (that mentioned Calvino's inspiration for writing these pieces) before I actually read the book. It did ruin it for me, a little.Also, this book is probably most valuable in small portions. The amount of metaphor seems to work best when you can read a piece or two and then get back to life. It can also be pretty repetitive, and because each story has a fairly definite beginning, middle and end, I found it to get a bit blurry after 3 or 4 stories in one go.",2008-04-27 14:27:17,3,en,2008-04-27 14:27:17,4,2008,0.00061,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,277
Clark,"I've been thinking about this book quite a bit since I finished it and I have decided that they way I choose to think about it is as a story about the infinity of possibility. It is, of course, a collection of descriptions of how a city could be and how a people could be and how the two shape each other. In that regard, my favorite passage is:This said, it is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.In other words, do we live our lives in a place that mutates along with us, ultimately becoming whatever we choose to project into our environment, or do we live our lives in a place that lacks flexibility, either crushing our humanity or becoming subsumed by it until the city itself is too damaged to live in? Or even more simply, are we choosing as individuals and as a broader people to live in the realm of infinite possibility and openness or are we choosing to close ourselves off to the idea of change, the invisible cities out on the horizon yet to be dreamed? This idea translates to macroscopic and microscopic views of the world. How do we run our country? How do we run our lives? Each of these forms can be filled in a limitless number of ways. We are rich with possibilities! It's a shame we don't celebrate it more.",2012-03-11 12:09:43,5,en,2012-03-11 12:09:43,3,2012,0.00123,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,287
Kirk Battle,"Invisible Cities is a part of the post-modern architectural movement which sought to impose meaning on a building beyond its intended function or form. There's a variety of architects or buildings that are examples of this, Bernard Tschumi is the leading example and his work in Parc de la Villette. Normally everyone just says 'Form follows function' and don't think about buildings as ideologies or symbols of authority. These people do. So Tschumi's work in the park are like these big decks with stairs going nowhere or big angular sides that are hard to understand when you're looking at them. The idea is that the structure's purpose is malleable but in practice they sort of...aren't good for anything really.Which is all just a basic introduction to the premise of these lovely poems and the discussion of memory and meaning that we assign to buildings. Marco Polo sits with Kubla Kahn and recounts tales of the incredible cities he has seen, some made of dreams and others incredibly exotic mysteries. Each city is built out of emotion and feeling, the occupants each living in their own individual city that no other can see, rendering them invisible.It's fun, wholly unique stuff driven by really interesting design philosophy. While architects tend to dismiss post-modern architecture as more suitable for theater or video game design, this book grabs something that the long, dull political papers never seemed to: the beauty of having control over the meaning of your surroundings. An excellent collection of poems.",2013-10-29 03:20:58,5,en,2013-10-29 03:20:58,10,2013,0.00082,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,250
Désirée,"Masterpiece. You spend half of the time enjoying the book and the other half wondering how someone can be as talented as Italo Calvino, which makes sense considering that the book is in some ways a literary exercise, a ""variation on the theme"" of 1001 nights. However, this reference model is constantly distorted and subverted in a playful way (for example, Marco Polo speaks of camels and caravans as much as airports and electric lights) which is one of the things that makes the book brilliant. As Pasolini says in the afterword, what makes the book wonderful is that it completely transports you in a surreal and oniric dimension which is at the same time extremely familiar and real, you soon realize that in the same way in which Marco Polo, as he says in the book, is talking about Venice in every city he describes, Calvino speaks about real cities every time he writes an imaginary one. I will forever remember this book also because is one of the few (maybe the only one) that I've read with someone else. My boyfriend and I read the short stories (many of them are not longer than 2 pages) in turns, trying to replicate the oral narrative that is established between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo in the book. I loved doing that and I highly recommend it, reading out loud or listening to someone else reading forces you to be extremely focused, which is not always ideal when reading but it works really well in this book since it helps to appreciate the extremely detailed and technical descriptions that Calvino does.",2021-02-22 18:40:17,5,en,2021-02-22 18:40:17,2,2021,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,271
Brian,"Marco Polo describes the many cities he's visited to Kublai Khan. Between the city descriptions Polo and Khan talk. This is Invisible Cities. If you're looking for story, if you're looking for character, if you're looking for lost symbols conjured up by a certain Brown... you won't find it here. You will find wonderful ideas and beautiful descriptions of cities and people. This was a little book that required a slow reading to enjoy the dense writing of Calvino.One day I hope to look up at the city of Baucis and wave. 'After a seven days' march through woodland, the traveler directed toward Baucis cannot see the city and yet he has arrived. The slender stilts that rise from the ground at a a great distance from one another and are lost above the clouds support the city. You climb them with ladders. On the ground the inhabitants rarely show themselves: having already everything they need up there, they prefer not to come down. Nothing of the city touches the earth except those long flamingo legs on which it rests and, when the days are sunny, a pierced, angular shadow that falls on the foliage.There are three hypotheses about the inhabitants of Baucis: that they hate the earth; that they respect it so much they avoid all contact; that they love it as it was before they existed and with spyglasses and telescopes aimed downward they never tire of examining it, leaf by leaf, stone by stone, ant by ant, contemplating with fascination their own absence.'",2009-10-01 08:27:51,4,en,2009-10-01 08:27:51,10,2009,0.00072,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,256
Eduardo Corona,"The Great Khan's empire, vast and rich as it is, is starting to rot, to come apart at the seams. Marco Polo comes back from his travels, they sit down in a timeless garden. Polo describes cities, all with a female name that foreshadows their character. He describes cities through memory, perception, desire, signs, the dead, the sky, what is traded and what is hidden. Through the narrative it becomes clear that he is describing but one city through multiple points of view, through the experience of the other he is describing his city of origin, Venice. Yet, through the dialogue with the Khan, we have access to an even deeper level of interpretation. The Khan's empire, Polo's travels, they all only exist through their awareness, in their mind's eye. And through that eye cities that could be, that were, that will be, that won't be, that exist in myth or imagination also come into life. And so, my conclusion is that in this masterpiece, Calvino is not describing one city in a multifaceted way, but is going one step further. He is describing the mind, how through human experience our perception colors the world, makes our cities and our surroundings what they are. We make the invisible cities visible, we give them names, we recognize signs, we keep them in our memories, we build them and destroy them with our wants and desires, we trade stories, we look at the sky for ideals, we infuse hidden corners with mystery and meaning.",2012-02-25 03:02:51,5,en,2012-02-25 03:02:51,2,2012,0.00087,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,252
Leslie S.,"“Invisible Cities”, by Italo Calvino, is one of the most wondrous books I’ve ever come across. It’s a book filled with short and magical narratives of cities with female names —Diomira, Isidora, Dorothea, Zaira, Anastasia, Tamara, etc. — as Marco Polo describes them to Kublai Khan as they walk through a garden and play chess. Fall in love with Baucis (the city built above clouds), Chloe (the great city filled with strangers who imagine stories with one another, but never actually stop), Valdrada (the mirror city, where everything that happens or exists is symmetrical as it reflects on the lake), Zemrude (the city which can be described in very different ways depending on the mood of the beholder), Leonia (the city that refashions itself every day, and where people throw out things from the day before), Theckla (its construction is taking such a long time so that its destruction cannot begin), Andria (the place where the city and the sky never remain the same), etc. Quotes:“Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.”“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”“You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.”“It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”",2016-09-21 23:59:46,5,en,2016-09-21 23:59:46,9,2016,0.00111,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,238

Sara,"This book is a pointillist painting. As I read the glimpses of cities, I feel like I'm looking at a part of a massive whole, like staring at a section of Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Stepping back, there's a larger piece there that makes a unified statement. The details feed the whole splendidly. There was a point at which I let the language and story wash over me and just enjoyed each description and story without reading very deeply, and I think this book can be enjoyed on that level as well. But these seemingly simple tableaus really carry a great deal of weight in a few words, and while letting the language and depiction wash over me, I also know that I'm going to end up returning to this book to digest it all. I ended up underlining a lot in this book, but I read If on a Winter's Night a Traveler first, and that gave me much higher expectations. Calvino is brilliant, and this would have probably gotten four stars if it had been written by someone else, but as a Calvino, I think my standard may be higher. I still recommend it, because it's a beautiful book and really talks about the plurality of experience and existence nicely, but it's just not as mind-blowing as I though Winter's Night... was.

Jason Furman,"This is a hard book to rate. At its best, it is mesmerizing and unique. It creates an imaginative universe of imaginary cities like none you've ever pictured before. My favorite was a city that created a twin city of the dead underground, where they placed the skeletons in positions as if they were doing jobs, but then as the underground city started to slowly evolve the above-ground one mirrored it, until it became unclear which city was copying which and which was the primary one. Dozens and dozens of cities like these are depicted in prose poems generally of one to three pages.These descriptions of cities are framed by a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan about these cities, a dialogue that is highly abstract and yet also feels completely real, like something Calvino discovered rather than created.The downside of Invisible Cities is that, at least for me, it did not repay a reading from beginning to end, even one that I did relatively slowly over the course of a few weeks. I loved many individual parts, liked the impression of the whole, but never fully ""understood"" it as a unified work of fiction and often felt like flipping through some of the cities. So, at least for me, it is a book I plan to dip back into random chapters in the future rather than read from beginning to end.",2012-11-08 09:57:11,4,en,2012-11-08 09:57:11,11,2012,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,233
Layal Amer,"“With cities, it is as with dreams,” ""Everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” Calvino writes about cities, but not just any regular cities, but imaginable cities, cities of desire, cities of memories, cities with no air but earth, cities that are part of the sky, ruined cities and utopian cities, the sad city, and the city of the sun, cities with imaginable names, cities that are more like ideas than they are real , and then he ends that all with the Infernal city , the city with ever narrowing circles. which is Dante's Inferno, and he offers two ways of escaping the Inferno, by becoming part of the Inferno that you will no longer see it, or by learning and discovering more. it's a book that enlighten your imagination, your feelings, and your urban vision.  well at the end this is a book like the city Tamara, you leave it without discovering it, and that's why i guess i'll be reading it over and over again, that every time you will see it from a completely different perspective. and the angels of such a book will never end.",2015-06-19 18:02:08,4,en,2015-06-19 18:02:08,6,2015,0.00227,0.00011,0.00021,0.00013,0.00024,0.0002,237
Annelise Eppen,"Even though I only read a translation of Calvino's novel, I still find it one of the most beautiful books I have ever encountered. Everything about it--the bizarre structure, the ambiguous chronology, the profound discussions between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo--is thought provoking and intensely satisfying. Most impressive, however, is Calvino's unique ability to bring cities to life through the power of his descriptions. Within each of the imagined cities lies not only a cohesive, well-planned structure, but also a clever observation about human nature, an observation woven intricately into each city through nuance and Calvino's dark sense of humor. As someone who has always loved cities and perceived that each city has a unique personality, I found that Calvino annunciated perfectly what draws me to the bustling, chaotic, crowded, often dirty places that repulse so many others. At a time when I was questioning my decision to spend the next four years of my life in cities, I took solace in the realization that cities are the richest and most fascinating products of human civilization. I understand why NYU had us read this.It's hard to reach the end of this book without feeling some intense wanderlust and wanting to explore every city in the world.

Sam,"This unusual book is one best taken in small doses. It's comprised of a series of vignettes in which Marco Polo describes a city he has visited, with interludes describing Polo's interactions with Kublai Khan. Since each section is so short, it's tempting to just read through it all very quickly. I think that would be a mistake though, as you lose some of the beauty by reading too quickly. Better to let the descriptions and musings sink in and marinate a little bit. The descriptions are beautiful. Reading about the different types of cities, the buildings and geography, made me want to hop in an airplane right now. The musings are a bit more hit-or-miss for me. Some of them are a little too ""look at how smart and philosophical I am"": ""you leave Tamara without having discovered it"" (14); ""Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city can begin to exist"" (19). Some are better than that, but the conversations between the Khan and Polo got a little too into navel-gazing for my taste. The variability of signs and significance is one of the constant themes throughout, and Calvino certainly makes his point that one person's perception is not another's, and both are constantly changing. I appreciate the book's unorthodox structure, and it is very quotable. Definitely recommend it to your English or philosophy major cousin.",2018-05-11 03:53:40,5,en,2018-05-11 03:53:40,5,2018,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,230
Lagobond,"What a treasure. This is what I imagine people are after as they seek religious experiences. This book is for savoring, not for finishing in one sitting. I read it one ""chapter"" at a time, sometimes with days or even months in between. I took 9 months to finish, which I find amusingly poignant. Invisible Cities is a meditation, a reflection, a dream sequence. It's allegorical poetry in prose. It's a collection of stories that aren't stories, and which speak of cities that aren't cities. If it's action and plot you're after; if you want a slim book because you enjoy a quick read; if you like to have things spelled out clearly: please keep looking. If you like to ponder the human experience; if you're willing to embark on a languid journey; if you value what's between the lines; if you long to see the shell of the known (human) universe crack open just a little, then yes: read Invisible Cities.This is the sort of book that makes me re-evaluate all my previously written 5-star reviews, just to be extra sure that my 5-star-reviews are truly reserved for the rare glittering gem. As an aside (though not really), hats off to the translator and the book designer.

Delia,"I loved this book. Throughout I kept thinking of Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry (which I slogged through and did not love). Upon finishing Invisible Cities, found out that Winterson is a huge fan of Calvino's. Sexing the Cherry is clearly an ode to Invisible Cities. But why did I enjoy Calvino and not Winterson? I never fully engaged with Winterson's prose even though I like her topics of gender(fluidity), sexuality, and imagination. Her writing was overwrought, the descriptions too florid for me. And while Calvino is also fanciful there's a formality that creates structure within a book that notably has little to no plot. Calvino's slim book was primarily about subjectivity and memory while also serving as a melancholic commentary on how humans perpetuate cycles of expansion and destruction. This may not be appealing for some readers but these are all things I love. Also, the language! Beautiful and atmospheric. Another element layered within the tales of imaginary cities were incisive points on many issues that weigh on modern society. Lastly, the stories and the choices in how they are framed are so clever that it leads the reader to engage very directly with thinking critically about the worlds presented in the book and thus asking us to think critically about the worlds we inhabit in our own lives. I look forward to revisiting this little gem of a book sometime.",2020-08-28 18:52:55,4,en,2020-08-28 18:52:55,8,2020,0.00081,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,232
Andrew,"Impressive, though not entirely enjoyable. I can recognize its brilliance without really having liked it that much. If you like poetry, you will appreciate this book more than I did. Each city description is flowery and organic both in its formation and the image it evokes in your mind. Unfortunately, my taste is not sophisticated enough; I´ve never been able to fully enjoy poetry, and the same goes with this book. It seemed pointless to me a lot of the time. After reading this, Baron in the Trees, and If on a Winter´s Night a Traveler, I still enjoyed the last one the best.The book picked up pace and attracted me more in the later chapters, especially 5-7, when the narrative was a little more coherent. The concluding conversation was poignant as well. Any way you look at it, Calvino is a master wordsmith. Trying to imagine how he comes up with such scenarios and descriptions is mind-boggling. It definitely merits another reading, perhaps in the order of each type of city. Normally, I put the three-star books in the ""To be exchanged"" pile, but this is one of the rare ones that has piqued my interest enough to keep around.@pointblaek",2009-07-11 00:54:48,3,en,2009-07-11 00:54:48,7,2009,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,201
Juniperus,"Previously I said Italo Calvino can’t write novels, which is still true, because Invisible Cities isn’t a novel. It’s a mock travelogue of Marco Polo recounting his adventures to Kublai Khan… or so the weak frame story is. It really is, like Castle of Crossed Destinies, a vehicle for literary play, except this time it works. The dialogues in the frame story don’t make much sense, and the book is better read as just micro fiction about fantastic cities. The cities Calvino describes range from Octavia, “the spider-web city,” to Perinthia, a city based on astrological signs. Maurilia is a city which is constantly mourning its old self, which reminded me of people who mourn “old Austin”… and perhaps this was the point of Marco Polo saying “every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.” The worldbuilding is dreamlike, almost like Monique Wittig’s Les Guérillères, and each city contains some universal truth that applies to every city in the real world, thinking of cities as gods or as having spirits. The problems endemic to this book are problems i have with Calvino’s œuvre in general: it lacks narrative purely in service of structure, and his specific brand of misogyny others women in the same way as If on a winter’s night a traveler.",2012-01-12 05:38:44,4,en,2012-01-12 05:38:44,1,2012,0.00103,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,217
Shoaib,"It's one of those books you'd want to come back to over and over again. Marco Polo describes cities that he has visited during the course of his travels as a royal agent to the great Kublai Khan, who listens to this foreigner in awe and wonder. Marco Polo's recitals do not necessarily correspond to the actual cities; he makes them up: marvellous places carved out of the formless ruins of Khan's devolving empire. If you leaf through the book, you'll find a city that corresponds to your idea of a city, or a city that you'd think you have come across already, or a city that you'd want to go to and see for yourself. Sometimes, you'd also come across cities that are unimaginable - like Panthisilea which is the outskirt of itself, beyond which there's no outside; which is the outside of itself.Finally, when you've exhausted all the ideas of cities, the quintessential question, as Kublai Khan puts it: if the last standing place can only be an infernal city, isn't it all useless? Perhaps, you'll agree with Polo who replies: The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live everyday, that we form by being together.",2015-01-19 18:59:02,5,en,2015-01-19 18:59:02,1,2015,0.00084,0.00011,0.00016,0.00013,0.00018,0.00016,216
Vampire Who Baked,"This is a book filled with metaphor and fantastic imagery which talks about ""cities""- a word which I use in the most abstract sense possible, to vaguely refer to a collective consciousness which manifests itself in the form of intricate rituals, rigid traditions and a system of beliefs and values that is the basis for a way of life. A city in this sense can be a city, a culture or even a single person who sees the world in a way distinct from, and at the same time similar to, everyone else. In a sense, reading this book is best captured by experiences involving travel metaphors- like scouring the labyrinthine back alleys of a major city in a futile attempt at navigation, haggling with a feisty seller at a flea market over a worthless trinket that speaks to you in a way you cannot explain, having a conversation with an elderly woman in the park sifting through the bookshelves in the library constructed from her memories.Do not look for a plot. Do not look for a travelogue. Do not look for realism. Do not look for denouement. The idea is to immerse yourself in the metaphor.(If this review didn't make sense to you, you should probably skip this book- or read other reviews, maybe someone else's way of reading this book would appeal to you more)",2015-02-21 13:30:55,4,en,2015-02-21 13:30:55,2,2015,0.0026,9e-05,0.00024,0.00011,0.00026,0.00017,227
Mark Valentine,"Once more, I have grown in my appreciation and respect for Calvino's works. He writes using precise words and never quits until he has portrayed an image in sentences. He is inventive, an original. This short novel has incredible power not for plot, but for characterization, imagery, and sheer force contained in the words.The characterization works like a photographic negative. He never tells us of Genghis Khan or Marco Polo; no descriptions or personality traits given. What he uses is their ideas and the things that they talk of to describe what kind of people they are. Thus, it is through their impressions on the template that I could tell what kind of characters they are. That is good, confident writing, I think.The imagery is powerful too. Calvino strives to make his cities visible in the imagination. This is one trait that I think will make him be read years and years from now. Take your time with this novel. In fact, I don't think that it is possible to even race through it. It's shortness is misleading, it is very dense and laden with vitality and deserves to be savored in enjoyment and not raced through in the reading. But if you can slow down and enjoy it, I think you will find it to be well worth the effort.",2016-01-17 23:35:49,5,en,2016-01-17 23:35:49,1,2016,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,221
Wahyu Novian,"It’s my second Calvino’s and I have this conclusion: he was one crazy author. This is another Calvino’s book that cannot be described. You need to read it yourself so you can experience it. We might have different opinions about this one. Because this book is about cities. And you can see cities with any angles you want. “... each man bears in his mind a city made only differences, a city without figures and without form, and the individual cities fill it up.” (p.34)Seriously, it’s only talked about cities. Mythical and impossible cities with extravagant descriptions. I don’t know that cities can be described with so many words and each one can be that distinct and yet so familiar at the same time. Calvino’s cities had this dreamlike qualities, contain quiet messages and sometimes brought prophetic warnings disguised as storytelling (I quoted someone’s review here since it’s true). Well, Marco Polo and Kubilai Khan talked about it. I’m wondering were they really had that relationship? “Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, theirs rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” (p.44)",2018-03-11 22:22:51,4,en,2018-03-11 22:22:51,3,2018,0.00134,0.0001,0.0002,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,197
Liz,"I recently received a small manila envelope in the the mail. It was from my brother, and it contained this book, with no enclosed note. I recently revealed that I have a secret ""book club"" with him - if he recommends a book to me, I read it immediately. Now that he is a witting co-conspirator in the book club, I was very amused that this was the book he sent. I am fairly certain I read it at some point in the 90s- I have a distinct memory of spending a hot afternoon in my first apartment reading Calvino cover to cover, but can't remember if it was Invisible Cities or If On A Winter's Night A Traveler.  This is the sort of meditative thought experiment of a book that can be read here and there in small snatches or, like me, read in one sitting on a cross country flight. It's plotless but as it is reflective of the Oulipo (google it - it's interesting) philosophy, mathematically planned and executed. The frame is a conversation between the explorer Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Polo is telling Khan of all the distant cities in his empire, and each city is different, dreamlike. It's a perfect book when you are feeling contemplative but it won't give easy answers, but koans for dreamy thought.",2018-05-30 19:02:58,4,en,2018-05-30 19:02:58,5,2018,0.00063,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,224

Victoria,"Marco Polo sits in a garden with Kublai Khan at the twilight of his empire, regaling the melancholy Tartar with tales of cities encountered during his travels. Polo describes cities that are, that have been and have yet to be; cities of desire, memory and the dead; sprawling cities, burgeoning cities, and cities on the edge of oblivion. Eventually, it becomes clear that he's describing the same place—everywhere and nowhere at the same time.Every chapter describes a city I have lived in, am living in or have yet to live in. Italo Calvino is one of those writers who writes so beautifully, it renews my faith in language as a higher art form. While this is definitely the type of book douche-y indie hipsters love to carry around to make themselves seem smart, it's an easy read. The chapters are short and to the point, yet pack a meaningful punch. Calvino makes you think, and tackles huge ideas, but does so in a way that feels like sitting to dinner with an old friend who has just returned from a long and distant journey.",2010-01-21 13:19:33,4,en,2010-01-21 13:19:33,1,2010,0.00083,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,184
J L Kruse,"Approaching a book as beautifully simple and profound as ""Invisible Cities"" requires nothing, merely a willingness to read as fast or as slow as one chooses, and to re-read passages or not based on one's desire for inspiration or fulfillment or escape. Calvino wrote this as a loose dialogue between the Great Khan and Marco Polo, but for me it is more of an aesthetic map, a parable of existence told through unfolding cities explored inside pure imagination. It is pleasurable and light, causing moments of reflection that can stretch back into pages circled and sections underlined. Passages like this make this work sublime:""Rarely does the eye light on a thing, and then only when it has recognized that thing as the sign of another thing: a print in the sand indicates the tiger's passage; a marsh announces a vein of water; the hibiscus flower, the end of winter.""Effortless, gorgeous, this novella reopens itself again each time you touch its pages, leaving images both vivid and irrepressible.",2012-12-22 06:55:17,5,en,2012-12-22 06:55:17,12,2012,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,167
Ann,"As Marco Polo describes the cities of the Kahn's empire to Kublai Kahn himself, each story is imbued with a metaphoric logic -- his descriptions are metafictive as often the narratives circle back to language and meaning-making. Calvino himself indexes his cities into subcategories -- ""Cities &amp; Signs,"" ""Continuous Cities"" -- allowing the reader to choose to read each city categorically. Kublai Kahn begins to question the authenticity of Polo's fantastic cities, and this breakdown of perception begins to raise questions about the truth-value of words; as the sage in the city of Hypatia says, ""signs form a language, but not the one you think you know."" The tension between the correlation between words as signs and the physicality of each city, however, is shown to be the very act of perception itself as ""falsehood is never in words; it is in things.""Another interesting aspect of Calvino's novel is the feminization of each city -- endowed with a feminine name, the cities themselves become characters, albeit ones that the explorers are penetrating and invasively cataloging.",2015-09-25 05:42:48,5,en,2015-09-25 05:42:48,9,2015,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,175

I've been curious about reading Italo Calvino's work and thought this might be a good start to it. The book was of course made in not a straightforward fashion and I bet is smarter than it seems (ex: the moving back and forth on the past and the future and also the current time; what a city would consists of - the living, the dead and the unborn; how a city takes its name but change as the people who lives in it move, or die, or just naturally fluctuates), but it was enjoyable nevertheless. It brings you to the city as it hold the mist in the morning, or a trading boat taking off its load, or how does it feel to spend a lifetime there compare to people who came just to visit, or simply made you think about that question you had: how intricate it must be to deal with garbage in this city.And now I'm curious how Calvino's style differs with Moravia! :)",2016-01-16 23:30:49,4,en,2016-01-16 23:30:49,1,2016,0.00102,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,195
a,"Impossible to give this any less than five stars even though it put me to sleep every time I tried to read it. A slippery and demanding book to read. It isn’t complicated really or hard to understand, but there’s no point in reading it if you’re not going to really conjure up the cities in your mind and it takes a fair bit of energy to sustain a city in your mind and even more energy to shift from city to city as often as you turn the page. I am confused by people who call this book prose poetry. It doesn’t seem poetic to me, at least not in the sense that those people mean poetic. It is not evocative, it is denotative. It reads to me like a straightforward book of maps. The cities may be invisible but they are already there inside you. It is a manual. Like Dante’s inferno, an exhaustive treatment of planes of human existence. And at the end finally we are told what this manual we are reading is teaching us to do: to find the things that do not fit the pattern, that can’t be matched to any analogue on the map, for lack of a better word the goddish.",2019-10-26 03:14:49,5,en,2019-10-26 03:14:49,10,2019,0.00124,0.0001,0.00019,0.00012,0.0002,0.00016,209
Max,"I can't say I got what I was expecting from Calvino. Based on Invisible Cities, he's not as profoundly, earth-shatteringly, achingly beautiful as everyone seems to think he is, but also he's not the pretentious European magical-intellectual I feared he might be. Invisible Cities is really pretty slight: a collection of imagined cities as described by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. And while some of them are lovely little creations of imagination, the work as a whole becomes sort of a numbing (but pretty) composite. It's not long enough to try one's patience, but it never really makes a mark in its brevity either. It's full of the narrative philosophizing that Kundera did better, more expansively, and with a better eye to character and plot. I'm going to read some more, though.

I abandoned his ""If a Traveler..."", I read his Cosmicomics and they were just ok, I read 40 of the 55 miniatures of this book before I couldn't stand it anymore and had to skip to the last page.Granted that there are deeper insights to be gained from each city description. There's certainly an elaborate ordering at work. The structure probably has a deeper meaning. I assume the book has important messages on men gathering in cities. Something like a common pattern, similarities in differences, the purpose of life and all that stuff. It's an intellectual masterpiece. But it annoyed me as hell. I'm not in for this kind of intellectual masturbation.

Dinesh Jayaraman,"Invisible Cities isn't as much a novel as it is an anthology (but surely a very novel one at that!). The cities in it straddle the real and the surreal, the familiar and the outlandish, Kafka (in style) and Borges (in imagination), the deeply moving and the incomprehensibly vague, prose and poetry.Calvino, as always, plays with the form of the novel as much as with its content. e.g., the content pages are a skyline of the cities in the novel and the city categories repeat in strict patterns. The cities themselves are not mere cities, but worlds unto themselves. Some cities in this collection, I recognized right away, for I have lived in them myself; some others I would like to visit some day; yet others I would be content simply with understanding some day.

The descriptions of cities tend to blend together after a while. I appreciate the craftsmanship of the structure of the book, but if it was half as short it would have had more impact on me.

Yet Invisible Cities was a quick, enjoyable collection of city descriptions, draped by a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. The descriptions, each different and bearing a feminine city name, remind me a lot of Borges and also Queneau (Exercises in style). This is a book that requires a re-reading and, like others have already done, the drawing of some sort of a plan, to fully understand the structure of the book (we are getting good hints with the 11 types of cities, arranged in a sort of symmetrical pattern) and all the possible links and overlaps between the descriptions.

His use of the word “invention” is also interesting and resonates with my own feeling that this book is an Idea Machine.The city descriptions are most fascinating and beautiful.

Now his accounts were the most precise and detailed that the Great Khan could wish and there was no question or curiosity which they did not satisfy. And yet each piece of information about a place recalled to the emperor's mind that first gesture or object with which Marco had designated the place. The new fact received a meaning from that emblem and also added to the emblem a new meaning. Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind's phantasms.

The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, that are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space"".

Kerfe,"""I speak and speak...but the listener retains only the words he is expecting....It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""This book is hard to classify. Poetic fiction? The ""story"" is this: Marco Polo describes cities he as visited in the vast empire of Kublai Khan. The Great Khan reacts and then both reflect. Or maybe it's all imaginary: the cities, the conversations, the men.Of course the cities, however fantastic, are only reflections of ourselves, of the vast fictions and constructions of man. I think this is one of those works to dip into randomly from time to time and contemplate.

Matt Sautman,"If one is to read this book as a novel, that reader will sorely be disappointed, but if one is to read this as a philosophical prose poem, Invisible Cities creates a rich commentary upon history, travel, interpretation, imagination, and plurality of meanings. A reimagining of a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn centers the book together, and it is through the ""fictions"" Polo presents that we are able to deconstruct the unified subject concealed within the invisible cities. Dreamlike, the descriptions of cities are but brief ephemera, occasionally requiring a reread to fully digest Calvino's true splendor.

Hengtee,"Invisible Cities is best read with an open mind. You could rack your brain working out the exact places Marco Polo talks about in his many tales of cities he visits, and you could read into each line looking for clues, but I feel the best approach to Invisible Cities is simply immersing yourself in the language; it weaves beautiful imagery of amazing places.There are some truly wonderful descriptions here of places, people, and feelings that feel right; as though the sensation has always existed within you and you simply didn't have the words for it. At other times you feel as though you are experiencing a location for the very first time.

I wonder how imagination seems to be able to do everything, even create cities out of thin air, but still it's never enough to imagine a world where gender expectations aren't an issue. So Calvino imagined worlds and made this book about literature and writing and creating, but apparently he can't imagine a world where women actually get to do something and aren't just part of the scenery. what I'm going to take from here: the wonderful dialogues, the thoughts on writing, the beautiful imagery. as for the rest, it was a boring book for me most of the time.",2017-10-29 07:52:00,2,en,2017-10-29 07:52:00,10,2017,0.00779,0.00012,0.0005,0.00015,0.00043,0.00035,160
Cam Netland,"Was not a fan of “if on a winters night a traveler” and had written off Calvino but when I was gifted this book at the coffee shop I decided to give him another chance and was FLOORED. This is an absolute must for anyone who loves poetry, traveling, and history. Beautiful language and a truly profound metaphor of our characters compounded with cities and their life/death cycles.For an example: imagine a city of both living and dead and then imagine there exists a counterpart of that city with those yet to be born. Do you believe there exist more in the city of the unborn or in the living and the dead? If you believe those who have lived outnumber those to come, then who will be/who was the last born in the city of the living before the balance was shifted?

So this short book became a very long journey. A beautiful journey.Wonderful if you are compelled to travel, and enjoy pausing between paragraphs for prolonged staring at a vague point in the distance.For some reason, it reminded me of chapter 47 of the Tao Te Ching:Know the universe without going out of the door.See the way of heaven without peeping through the window.The farther you go out, the far less you know.Therefore, the age knows without travelling, And names without looking,And accomplishes with no action.",2010-01-15 15:35:04,5,en,2010-01-15 15:35:04,1,2010,0.0009,0.00011,0.00016,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,111
Matthew,"It doesn't do it justice to describe this book as series of poetic descriptions of mostly impossible cities hung loosely on a thin plot. But that's correct.

If you like architecture and travel, then this may be a book for you.

Andrea,"There were pieces that were beautifully poetic, but as a whole, the book was a dreamlike meander that unravels (or concludes) with indulgent over-analyses. The descriptions all give it a much firmer character than the book actually offers. I feel like this is one of those books I should love, and that I appreciate, but just can't fall in love with. I think this would appeal to college students in the midst of deconstructing philosophies and literature - perhaps the characters in The Marriage Plot. This is definitely a book I would have to retry when I'm in the proper mood - now that I know to expect poetry, and not novel.

Scott,"Calvino sets up the book as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where Marco relates all the cities that he has seen in fact and imagination. There is no real story or narrative. It's collections of tales of cities, all of which are analogies for different perspectives, philosophies, value systems, and ideals (or tragedies) of life. It reads more like poetry than fiction and as such it requires the active input and response/reflection of the reader. The reader should take her time with it. I enjoyed it but it took me a little time to get into it and understand what it was doing. If you've never read Calvino before, I recommend ""The Baron in the Trees"" which has more of a straight-forward narrative.",2013-06-29 20:12:25,4,en,2013-06-29 20:12:25,6,2013,0.00057,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,126

Carmen,"This is one of those books that is short, so you feel accomplished because you read through its tiny chapters in quick succession. It's also filled with beautiful language, so you feel inspired by description and nice prose. But it piles metaphor on top of metaphors, allusions and amplifications, personified, anthropomorphic cities with feminine names that blur into their descriptions and fail to distinguish themselves from each other. And in this swamp of nice language, you learn that they aren't really being told at all, but rather the character telling it (Marco Polo) is actually grunting and pantomiming his way through the descriptions.

Many people dislike tomatoes. Sometimes you feel like an apple and a tomato just won't satisfy.Rating this book (is this a book, really? It certainly isn't a novel...is it?) less than 5 stars seems ridiculous, considering some of the insights I have gained about my self and the world have literally changed me forever.

The lack of cohesion moved this from a five-star to a four-star read for me, but I'm intrigued enough, and the book is short enough, that I think I'll read it again immediately. I'm looking forward to discussing this with on of my GR groups, and maybe coming to understand it a little more deeply than I'm able to just reading it myself. Calvino's writing is excellent - clever, evocative, concise.

Samuel,"A fiendishly difficult book to describe, as is typical of Calvino, Invisible Cities is a series of brief ""descriptions"" -- prose poems, really -- about various cities that may or may not exist, narrated by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, interspersed with brief exchanges between the two characters. However, that dry summary does little to explain the experience of this tightly-constructed gem, or why it's so magical, melancholy, and illuminating.There's almost nothing here that isn't pure gold. I suppose the last page is a little neat of a wrap-up for me, but that's the only quibble of any kind I can think of.

Although it is a short book it did take me most of the month to read, since I kept loosing interest and reading other books.

Jake M.,"Calvino's Invisible Cities is hard to effectively articulate. I can say that it is written as a set of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan and how one interacts, perceives and uses urban environments. There is a healthy dose of surrealism and magical realism used to tease out otherwise overlooked, common aspects of many cities. The elements of physical environment, time, change and perspective are heavily used to encourage readers to reevaluate their surroundings. The dialogue between the two characters is engrossing and vivid leaving the reader to contemplate the blindspots of knowledge surrounding the interactions between Polo and Khan.

The problem with these two books is that since each few pages talks about a different look on a similar theme. In this case the author talks about different cities. The problem with this is that some descriptions are really interesting and unique, while others are boring and you just want to get to the next one. I was close to giving this a 3 star rating, however the conversations that happen between the Khan and Marco Polo in the beginning and end of each chapter was really interesting.

Zachary,"What to make of this bizarre and complicated text? Invisible Cities marks my first foray into the work of Cuban-Italian author Italo Calvino, with whom I am not at all otherwise familiar. I am, however, a tourist, and a tourist who has visited both many cities and many Italian cities, which motivated me to read this postmodern Italian classic so eloquently translated by William Weaver. When it comes to tourists, most of whom are not poets, hardly anyone ever takes the time to capture the essence of an urban landscape in their travel journal. At the very least, I know that despite my proclivity to appreciate cities, I almost never do this. My travel journey mostly consists of, “First, I went here, and then there, and then I shared this wonderful conversation with a local about his culture and political views.” When I return home, and someone asks me about what a place is “like,” it is consequently difficult for me to describe succinctly how that place felt, what it communicated to me as I walked amidst its monuments and conversed with its people. For this reason, first and foremost, I was enamored with Invisible Cities, a novel ostensibly crafted for travelers. Marco Polo, the prototypical tourist, serves a central role in two interleaved narratives linked with his relationship with Kublai Khan, the emperor of China. In one, he describes a litany of cities in poetic terms: cities of memory, desire, names, and the dead, thin cities, continuous cities, hidden cities, cities that elude the traveler and others that disclose their secrets with just a bit of effort. In the other, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo converse—either in their heads, or in person, or via charades and even chess—about the nature of the Khan’s empire, whose cities Polo has visited in his mercantile travels.The two narratives do not necessarily complement one another. Indeed, that in which Polo describes cities with names such as Ersilia, comprised of nomads who concretize their urban relationships with thread wherever they happen to live, or Clarice, which has been rebuilt countless times with the spoliated ruins of its previous iterations, is not really a narrative at all, and rather some sort of surrealist almanac whose order is dictated above all by form—perhaps mathematical, perhaps poetic. For me, these prose poems represent the best parts of the novel; the interludes between each chapter, which constitute the other narrative, are sometimes simply too inscrutable for my tastes. I often wondered whether to interpret the impenetrable conversations between the Khan and Polo as evocative poetry or real metaphysics, since the pair often discuss whether the cities of the empire are real or fabricated, whether they themselves are real, and the nature of truth. So, when I read the subsequent back-and-forth about whether “those who strive in camps and ports exist only because we two think of them,” I am, as an interpreter, stumped.  POLO: Then the hypothesis must be rejected. So the other hypothesis is true: they exist 	and we do not. 	KUBLAI: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be.	POLO: And here, in fact, we are. There is little here for me to latch onto, either as a reader or a philosopher. I rather not dwell on this point—I think that there is far more to the novel than such inscrutabilities—yet I nevertheless maintain that they never quite captured my attention.In any event, I adore how some of the urban prose poems remind me immediately of cities with which I am intimately familiar. For instance, Zemrude, a city divided into two, as it were, about which “you cannot say that one aspect of the city is truer than the other, but you hear of the upper Zemrude chiefly from those who remember it, as they sink into the lower Zemrude,” evokes so clearly Catania, a city in Sicily that looks markedly different dependent on whether one look at its tall monuments and white-washed churches or blackened streets. Similarly, Phyllis, a city that “fades before your eyes” when you “stay in Phyllis and spend the rest of your days there,” reminds me of Syracuse, New York, my hometown, whose hidden surprises and pleasantries I now constantly overlook. “Phyllis is a space in which routes are drawn between points suspended in the void,” and that which occupies the space between those points matters little to the weary citizen who has lived there all her life. “Your footsteps follow not what is outside the eyes,” Calvino writes, “but what is within, buried, erased.”Therein lies the beauty of Invisible Cities: each city described by Polo in some way reflects a city known and loved by his listener, Kublai Khan, and us, his readers. They are all in some way tied to Venice, Polo’s famous medieval home, whose qualities are implicitly shared by all other cities, even those in the Khan’s far eastern empire. Here, Calvino reminds his itinerant readers that wherever they travel, they carry with them the memories, desires, and histories of all the other cities that they have visited, especially that which they call home. One must apprehend a new urban landscape with reference to what one has seen and loved before; there is no other way. And yet, at the same time, the traveler must remain open-minded to the surprises that await her in a new city, resolutely prepared to embrace the furtive unknowns that resist disclosure to the conceited tourist. Above all else, Calvino’s Marco Polo strikes me as a humble visitor, keen and observant while nevertheless respectful and appropriately passive. He recounts what he can truthfully describe about a city and no more. For some cities, not unlike people, remain mysterious to the last. They are Other, completely unknowable, impossible to possess, and therefore worthy of our adoration.",2017-07-03 22:34:08,4,en,2017-07-03 22:34:08,7,2017,0.00068,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,967

Robert Sheppard,"SCHEHERAZADE AND HER OFFSPRING----""A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS, ARABIAN ENTERTAINMENT,"" JOHN BARTH'S ""DUNYAZADIAD,"" ITALO CALVINO'S ""INVISIBLE CITIES,"" GÜNELI GÜN'S ""ROAD FROM BAGHDAD,"" AND ASSIA DJEBAR'S ""A SISTER TO SHEHERAZADE""----FROM THE WORLD LITERATURE FORUM RECOMMENDED CLASSICS AND MASTERPIECES SERIES VIA GOODREADS—-ROBERT SHEPPARD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF""The Thousand and One Nights,"" or ""Alf Layla Wa Layla,"" is often considered the archetypal narrative text, or the ""Mother of All Narrative,"" and this may well explain the universal scope of its appeal and enduring influence over the millennia as one of the central classics of World Literature. Its origins and authorship are obscure, and its narrative matter most likely evolved and coalesced over centuries in various cultures of the Middle-East, including Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Mesopotanian, Arabic and other sources before being integrated into a masterful organic whole sometime during the Golden Age of Islamic Culture under the Abbasid Caliphate, and becoming publicly known and acknowledged sometime in the 12th Century. No single author of the work has been identified, and most likely it was edited into its present form in several stages, beginning with an Arabic adaptation of a looser prior Persian collection, the ""Hazar Afsana"" (Thousand Tales) into a more organic whole. What we know in the West as the 1001 Nights was also shaped by the translation and further editing by the foremost Western translator, the French Orientalist Jean Antoine Galland (1646-1715) who added additional tales from the Mid-East not included in the original Arabic version, most famously those of ""Aladdin's Lamp"" and ""Ali Baba and the Forty Theives.""If the source material is diverse and multi-cultural, nonetheless the culminating integration of the Arabian Nights into a whole reflects the Arabic and Islamic worldview, with its philosophical and religious assumptions. The Islamic Caliphate in the wake of its amazing conquests from Spain to India was faced with the immensse task of handling and integrating dozens of diverse and ancient cultures while attempting to maintain the sources of its own internal cohesion, centered on the Koran and Hadith, in which it was only partly successful. ""The Thousand and One Nights"" thus constitutes in effect a mirror of the Islamic world, a melange composed of the peoples of a myriad of cultures and histories, and of Arabic culture's ability to assimilate these varied strands of influence. The bulk of its stories center on the two great cultural centers of gravity in the Islamic world, Baghdad and Iraq on one side and Egypt on the other, and though one finds characters in the stories of Hebrew, Christian, Zoroastrian, Indian, Persian and even Chinese origin, characteristically one sees their conversion to Islam and never vice-versa. The organic unity of the incredibly diverse tales and stories of the 1001 Nights lies in their rootedness and constant interplay with the ultimate frame story, that of the vizir's daughter, Scheherezade, the narrator of the extended tales over the one-thousand and one nights, and her perpetually impending death at the hands of her husband, King Shahrayar. Thus the book opens with the account of the visit of the King's brother, Shahzaman, who is grieved at having been forced to execute his wife for unfaithfulness, having discovered her in flagrante delicto with the palace cook. King Shahrayar then discovers his own wife, the Queen, engaging in orgies alongside her serving maids, with several black slaves disguised in women's dress, and orders his vizir to execute all of them. Concluding in his grief that henceforth no woman can ever be trusted, he then adopts a brutal plan to marry a new wife every night and having slept with her, order the vizir to execute her at dawn each morning before she has the chance to make the King again a cuckold. This he continues each night and day until hundreds of brides have met their death and the kingdom is thrown into a universal horrified grief. Finally, the vizir's own daughter, Scheherezade, asks her father the vizir to marry her to the King, come what may. Over her father's objection she marries Shahrayar, sleeps with him, and with her expected execution looming, calls for her sister Dunyazade to join them in their last hours before daybreak. Dunyazade then asks Scheherezade to entertain the King and herself with her lively stories, and she does so, so entrancing the King with the beginning tale, cut short in a ""cliff hanger"" pause before its ending, that the King postpones her execution until the next night so that he can hear the continuation of the tale. With this ""sword of Damocles"" hanging over her head, Scheherezade then continues in the same way for each of the suceeding thousand nights, so entrancing the King and leaving him desirous of the continuation of the stories, which proliferate endlessly, that her execution is continually deferred. The narrative thus works through the suspension of time by using storytelling to stop its flow, the suspension of time in turn enhancing the narritive in reciprocal circularity of effect. Within this circularity the continuous story develops through variations, echoes, and forward and backward references, rather than linear causal sequences. Each tale thus generates the kernels and seeds of further stories to come, and the overall unity of the work is generated from the interlinking and embeddedness of each story in the others. The stories thus are similar to the familiar nested ""Russian Dolls"" in which opening one doll one finds another, then another, ad infinitem. The variety of the stories are legion and encompass almost every genre later to be elaborated in World Literature. THE CRIME FICTION GENREExemplary instances of the crime or murder mystery and suspense thriller genres, associated with Wilkie Collins, Poe and Conan Doyle are found in abundance in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements, such as ""The Three Apples."" In that tale, Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid Caliph, comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the dead severed body of a young woman. Outraged, Harun gives his vizier, Ja’far, three days to find the culprit or be executed himself . At the end of three days, when Ja’far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman’s husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a certain slave, who had wrongfully taken one of the apples of the title, inadvertantly causing the woman’s murder. Harun then gives Ja’far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers at the last minute by chance his daughter has the missing apple, which she obtained from Ja’far’s own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.THE HORROR FICTION GENREThe Arabian Nights tale of ""Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad"" revolves around a house haunted by jinns, who are superhuman spirits, genies or demons. This Nights story alongside many others is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls. Another prime example is the story ""The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib,"" in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to Islam.THE FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION GENRESeveral stories within the One Thousand and One Nights feature early science fiction elements. One example is ""The Adventures of Bulukiya,"" where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of djinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In ""Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud"", the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets.In another 1001 Nights tale in the fantasy genre, ""Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman"", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist, echoing also elements of Sir Thomas More's ""Utopia."" Other Arabian Nights tales depict also Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. ""The City of Brass"" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city, which has now become a ghost town. FEMINIST NARRATIVE----THE FIRST FEMINIST NARRATIVE IN WORLD LITERATUREIt may seem strange to find early feminist literature within such an Arabic Medieval work expressive of a culture and tradition usually presumed to be the exact opposite of feminist concerns. Yet the entire structure of the 1001 Nights is that of Scherezade's courageous use of her magnificent intelligence, depth of feeling, creativity and humanity to not only defer the irrational homicidal violence of a male tyrant, but in the very process to re-educate and acclimatize him to greater tolerance and humane civilization. One story of a feminist bent I particulary enjoyed was that of ""The Tale of Sympathy the Learned."" In this tale, a female slave named Sympathy, tested by her master and later the Caliph, demonstrates her knowledge as being far superior to all the greatest scholars in Islam. By the end of the tale, she is universally praised for both her loyalty and intelligence and receives for herself and her master wealth and power, rewarded by the Caliph. By telling this tale, Sheherazade is offering the King a new ideal about how women can be trustworthy and virtuous servants. Women can also be as knowledgeable about life and sometimes more so than men if they put the same effort and ability into their studies as men. Women are not predisposed to ignorance based only on their sex. Sheherazade the narrator herself shares many of the qualities of her protagonist Sympathy. She has also studied much about Islamic culture and ideals as the daughter of the Vizir. Sheherazade also uses her cleverness to accomplish her goals. Sympathy uses knowledge to gain riches for her master and Sheherazade uses knowledge to concoct tales to a tyrant King in order to gain liberation for her people. Both women fight through prejudice to achieve some status by the end of their prospective stories. Sympathy in some ways is a fictional alter ego of Sheherazade.THEMES OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS----FATE &amp; DESTINYA common theme in many Arabian Nights tales is fate and destiny. Most of the tales begins with an ""surfacing of destiny"" which manifests itself through an anomaly; one anomaly always generates another,so a chain of anomalies is set up, building to a story of fascination and enchantment. The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to ""normality"" in which destiny sinks back into its invisibility in our daily life. The protagonist of the stories may in fact be seen as destiny itself.THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS IN WORLD LITERATUREThe influence of the 1001 Nights on World Literature has been and remains profound. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib Mahfouz paid homage to it in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the Nights include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Goethe, Walter Scott, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins, Elizabeth Gaskell, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal, Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, Pushkin, Tolstoy, Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W. B. Yeats, H. G. Wells, Cavafy, Calvino, H. P. Lovecraft, Marcel Proust, A. S. Byatt and Angela Carter. Themes and motifs with parallels in the Nights are found in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" (in The Squire's Tale the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and Boccaccio's ""Decameron"" as well as Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso."" Four modern writers who have not only been influenced by The Nights but gone on to develop its themes and techniques further in unique directions deserve special mention and individual attention: JOHN BARTH'S ""DUNYAZADIAD"" John Barth is one of America's formost ""Post-Modern"" writers, and in his modern narrative epic ""Dunyaziad"" he upends the classical tale of the 1001 Nights by retelling it from the perspective of Scheherezade's younger sister, Dunyazade. In this retelling Scheherezade is able to tell so many enchanting stories not from her native creative genius but because each night a bald, bespectacled, middle-aged genie appears from the future to tell the tales from a book he has already read: ""The Thousand and One Nights."" This ""genie"" is clearly Barth himself, who epitomizes the ""intertextual"" process by which stories ""tell themselves"" and are transmitted from the past to the future and back again, almost independently of their supposed ""authors."" Like most of Barth's narratives, it is intensely self-referential, commenting on its own structure and motifs as they evolve through their narration, often featuring frames within frame narratives, featuring characters who themselves are writers and storytellers in a post-modern metanarrative mise-en-abime. ITALO CALVINO'S ""INVISIBLE CITIES"" In his work Italo Calvino joins history's caprices with the whimsey of imaginative fancy. Like Jorge Luis Borges, whom he admired, his novels and tales often read as allegories on the human capacity to find worlds in words and to reveal the fragility of the human condition and of what we take to be historical or material reality in our lives. In one of his more delightful concoctions, ""Invisible Cities"" Calvino brings together two fertile and febrile sources: Scherezade's sea of stories and his partly factual, partly fantastic extension of of Marco Polo's Travels. Kublai Khan in fact sent Polo on several ""fact finding"" missions to the distant corners of his empire. In ""Invisible Cities"" his reports back to the Khan grow increasingly fantastic as he crosses the border between reality and the imagination. As the Emperor, Polo and the Empire bloat and age, with each return to the throne Polo becomes a Scherezadian storyteller, imposing his will to fancy on reality, just as the Emperor imposes his will to power on reality, engaging in an extended meditation on the sovereign powers of storytelling itself. GÜNELI GÜN'S ""ROAD FROM BAGHDAD"" Günelli Gün is a Turkish female writer educated in the United States and an award-winning translator of Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk's novel, ""The New Life."" In her feminist picaresque ""The Road to Baghdad"" she presents us with a modernized and post-modernized reworking of the Arabian Nights saga, replete with gender-bending, morphing, cross-dressing and transgressive identities that balance her created world on the cutting edge between unreality and surreality. Interweaving myth, fact and fiction, Gün creates a fanciful, old-fashioned epic that spans the breadth of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and tells a meandering tale of a woman's travels and travails. The awkward young Huru's adventures begin when her brother abandons her during a journey from Istanbul to Baghdad. By the end of her rambles, when she trades her musical talent for something more valuable, Huru has spent time disguised as a boy and has married a woman; she has seen Persia, Turkey and Syria and traveled through time; she has married a Sultan, borne his son and survived--with help from the spirit world--by her wits and her talent for playing her stone lyre. In the Post-modern idiom she uses the self-referentiality of the narrative with its colloquial theatricality to attempt to unmask what is perceived as the constructedness and fictiveness of the ""reality"" in which we presume to live. ASSIA DJEBAR'S ""A SISTER TO SHEHERAZADE""Assia Djebar is a renown Algerian writer who was the first Algerian woman admitted to the prestigous Ecole Normale Superieure in France prior to Independence. Thereafter she became perhaps the most internationally visible woman writer in the Arab world. Her work speaks forcefully for human rights universally, and women's rights in particular. In her rendering of the material of the ""Thousand and One Nights"" she universalizes the experience of Scheherezade to that of all brides on their wedding nights, mapping the collision of the world of fairy tales with the realities of centuries old traditions and the powers of men and society, dramatizing the timelessness of women's subjugation to realities beyond their control, passing from innocence into experience----that is through the rites of initiation into the timeless Sisterhood of Scherezade. A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS AND SPIRITUS MUNDIThe ""Thousand and One Nights"" also significantly influenced the composition of my own work, most notably my contemporary epic Spiritus Mundi. In particular, the chapter ""Neptune’s Fury &amp; The Perils of the Sea"" including the embedded novella ""Naval Diaries and Ship’s Logs of Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius (1780-1875)"" reflect the themes and techniques of the 1001 Nights. In it we follow the fate of the modern protagonist Sartorius' ancestor, Royal Navy Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius as he experiences a realm of fantastic adventure, from participating in the naval battles of Trafalgar and Egypt with Lord Nelson, to shipwreck on the Indian Ocean, his sexual encounter with the sorceress ""Lilith"" or Sir She, and most significantly his confinement in the palace of the ""Sultan of the Sea of Stories"" in which, like Scheherezade, he and his fellows, Billali the aged scholar, Ibn Battuta the Arab world traveller, and Princess Nooaysua, a Scheherezadian heroine, must daily invent and compose a series of stories for the Sultan's pleasure, on pain of death. In conclusion, I would recommend to all of you to take the time to read and enjoy the 1001 Nights and lose yourself in its narrative web and spell, as well as taking a look at its modern and post-modern spiritual offspring in the works of John Barth, Italo Calvino, Günelli Gün, Assia Djebar and in Spiritus Mundi.

Daniel,"Calvino's invisible cities are spatial allegories for the intricate patterns that unite and separate us. The book's a work of poetic sociology, and with such marvelous language.Speculative notes on Le città invisibili:1	. . . . .	The dizzy sense of insecurity Khan experiences after the initial imperial pride: he will never understand his empire, which is already disintegrating. Polo sees “the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.”Memory	1	To envy those who misremember their past as happyMemory	2	To observe yourself in your youth from the distance of ageDesire	1	The discovery of love that opens new pathsMemory	3	Indentations on city features made by its history Desire	2	All-encompassing erotic love that ensnaresSigns	1	The elusive essence concealed benevath a “coating of signs” Memory	4	An allegory encyclopedias (calcified inventories of human knowledge)? Desire	3	The traveler who seeks “home” in love and the homebody who seeks “adventure” in loveSigns	2	The tendency to generalize about something based on single experiencesThin	1	Religions of resource and of the agents of resourcfulness	. . . . .	Marco does not offer imperial statistics but emblematic descriptions of each of the imperial cities he visits. Not knowing any of the Levantine languages, he first evokes the cities through gestures and sounds and objects he brings back from his travels. Eventually he masters the regions’ languages and conveys more precise information. His descriptions are “emblems” and “logogriphs” (word puzzles). Khan wonders whether together they make up “a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms.” To know all of the mind’s phantasms is not to possess them, Polo says. 2	. . . . .	The past is mutable: Marco’s traveling proves this. He construes or imagines his past differently from the different vantage points of the cities he visits. With every new experience, he finds that his past changes (because he understands it in a new light). [T. S. Eliot explains how this happens to literary history in “Tradition and the Individual Talent.] Marco travels to rediscover his past and his possible futures (described as a Borgesian garden of forking paths). Anyone might have been someone else if they had taken a different path in life: cities are a “negative mirror” in that they show you all that you are not and will never be. Sense of self and identity are not based on perspective and contingency and have no ontological stability; traveling allows one to see that—something Kahn cannot quite yet see from his fixed location. Memory	5	Names create an impression of stability at odds with the ontologically fluctuating essenses to which they referDesire	4	The various selves you hoped to becomeSigns	3	Meaning based on semiotic differenceThin	2	Cities shape desire or desire erases a city’s structureTrading	1	Storytelling enriches perspective	. . . . .	The narrator retells the process through which Polo learns the Levantine languages. There is pleasure and joy in inventing a language for he first time, when signs are open, unmade, unstable. Polo’s gestural news is encircled by a “void not filled with words,” just as the descriptions of the cities he brings back. The city descriptions, it seems then, are the open-ended beginnings of a new language system. They first attempt to describe something for which there is still no language. Marco and Kahn develop a sign language that, once fully developed, looses the excitement of discovering meaning anew. The act of imagining a sign or city for the first time is an act of poetry.3	. . . . .	Kahn proposes a city, but it’s already been proposed by Polo. Polo excludes possible cities without a “connecting thread, an inner rule, a perspective, a discourse.” Cities are like dreams; they are rebuses that “conceal a desire or, its reverse, a fear.” “Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” Through this description, Polo offers two hermeneutic strategies to decipher the hidden meaning of his cities: allegorical interpretation and psychoanalysis. Desire	5	The madness of unrequited loveSigns	4	Language is deceitful because referents change while words stay the same [library of babel.]Thin	3	Open-ended refreshment Trading	2	Impressions and hypothetical relationships with other people are tradedEyes	1	We’re more concerned with how we appear than with what we are; we pander to appearances [Mirror]	. . . . .	Kahn imagines a city, which Polo deciphers as the city of final departures. The question of whether or not these imagined cities correspond to real cities is broached but not answered. 4	. . . . .	Polo says what it is he’s doing: “examining the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed,” “peering at the faint lights in the distance” while in darkness. He is imagining the “other possible cities that vanish to make room” for Khan’s vision of the perfectly fixed diamond-hard crystalline empire. [As with closed and stable and possessed languages, a closed and stable and possessed empire is similarly dead.]Signs	5	Falsehood is in things rather than wordsThin	4	Lightness of the imagination and play is always accessible; the solid world changesTrading	3	Weariness with sameness that leads to exchange of old lifeEyes	2	Our mood and attitude determines how we see the worldNames	1	Language (perhaps ancient ones in particular)	. . . . .	Kahn and Polo develop alternative but related algorithms for figuring out which cities “exist.” What makes a city exist is its balance of normal and exceptional features. If it errors too much in either direction of the normative or the exceptional it probably doesn’t exist. 5	. . . . .	Kahn dreams of an empire not merely expanded but grown rich within itself, fleshed out in success with “cities that weigh upon the earth and upon mankind, crammed with wealth and traffic, overladen with ornaments and offices, complicated with mechanisms and hierarchies, swollen, tense, ponderous.” Then he changes his mind, wanting a lighter empire of with cities “light as kites appear, pierces cities like laces… transparent as mosquito netting,” cities that can breath. This is a city that “grows in lightness” rather than “wealth”—thanks to the benevolent moon.Thin	5	Hanging on Trading	4	Spatial metaphor for the official relationships between people Eyes	3	To be disconnected from the world for several reasonsNames	2	Fable about the real and our flickering names for the realDead	1	The existing roles we inhabit change through time, and therefore we do, too—but it all leads to death.	. . . . .	Implied: a city’s constituent elements are like stones that make an arch; it’s only together than the stones make a bridge. If Polo’s cities are like bridges, do they lead to anywhere but other bridges? 6	. . . . .	Kahn visits a city lately acquired and listens to Polo telling stories of different cities. All of them, Polo reveals, are versions of his native Venice, which he takes as his archetypal city. To put Venice into words is to lose “memory’s images”; it is for this reason that he reimagines this city: so he doesn’t lose it all at once.

Are Polo’s cities “moods, states of grace, elegies”? They smoke their pipes, and through the light or dense smoke are visions of light or oppressed cities. 7	. . . . .	Kahn’s garden is a state of mind that can be accessed simply by shutting one’s eyes. One can imagine oneself to be anyone one likes. Kahn and Polo speculate as to whether they themselves are real or the imaginings of two beggars. [Are they dreaming or being dreamed?

Kahn is unsure what his chess games amount to (games centered on winning or losing); then Polo shows him how the grooves and rings in the wooden chess board tell stories about the tree that was used to make it, the maker of the board, the creatures that lived in the tree, the economy that produced it. Kahn is stunned by how much Polo (the poet) can see in so little.9	. . . . .	Divided into three sections that invite us to look into Kahn’s Atlas: its representations of all the imperial cities, of the entire planet, of all the cities that ever have or will be.

In the final section, we learn that Kahn’s atlas contains representations of all the utopias and dystopias that have ever been dreamed up. Khan laments that all is tending to the inferno. Polo tells him to “seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”",2017-04-22 04:48:20,5,en,2017-04-22 04:48:20,4,2017,0.00105,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00017,1609
Jason,"The problem with this book is that its prose. If these ideas had been transferred in poetry, using a lyrical sway to carry the message, I think Calvino might have pulled off better what he wanted to express. 	The book is a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Polo excites and intrigues Khan in telling him of all the worldly descriptions of cities within Khan’s empire. The rest of the book is 1-2 page descriptions of these “invisible cities,” which Khan has inquired about. Throughout the book it is again and again reintroduced that all the cities Polo describes are the same city, and that this “one city” could be any city if you use the right mind.	To make the transfer of the information into metaphor I think the idea has to be spoken by poetry, using the flight within everyday to carry the symbolism of an otherwise mundane existence into the frenetic “happenings” of tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. 	This is where I think Calvino struggles, laying to text a wordy, pretentious divulgence in finding the beauty of city life, cataloguing seemingly mundane artifacts found in rural towns and cities--rather than getting carried away with fancy. This could be alright, if it wasn’t so borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. It lacks the appropriate style and is ill-fatedly repetitious. To be honest, a lot of the problem in this novel comes from it being too boring.  	The book reads like a travelogue. It is dense with description, but it is also filled with the vain characteristics of one who treasures a city—but quixotically expects other people to hold that same gravity for the weight of cities. Who reads travel books for leisure? Old bags with too much time on their hands, not enough cash to travel. Real adventures start in these exotic places, not at the gilded edge of the church steeple, but in the sewer, in basements and with cavalier excitement. He approaches these beautiful cities, with interesting glances into their simple-mindedness and approach to city life, but does not allow us for the most part to explore the riches of the city’s attitude, of its raciness, its heartbeat and such. I do like his metaphors, drawn from an idea of painting civilization in thought amongst the questions “who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?...” The ideas he is unearthing are sad facts of the prudence of humanity’s city builders ineptly trying to discern perfect cities, but finding fault in the impractical and spiritual voids. He describes one city, Perinthia, whose:Astronomers divided the map according to the twelve houses of the zodiac so that each temple and each neighborhood would receive the proper influence of the favoring constellations…Perinthia—they guaranteed—would reflect the harmony of the firmament; nature’s reason and the gods’ benevolence would shape the inhabitants’ destinies…In Perinthia’s streets and square today you encounter cripples, dwarfs, hunchbacks, obese men, bearded women. But the worse cannot be seen; guttural howls are heard from cellars and lofts, where families hid children with three heads or with six legs…Perinthia’s astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all the calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in the city of monsters.Hunched in the text, leveled in the simple description is a grand metaphor that chastises, in this case, the ineptitude of scientific innovations and religious ideas used in the way to build a city; what he could be alluding to here in astronomical arrangements is as strange as the placement of stones for Stonehenge to the emplacement of windows to face east towards Mecca. It’s a discernment of classical tastes that tried to arrange fate around living spaces, and it is densely criticized in the poetry of his travelogue, which like so many travelogues, is so difficult to approach poetically because it is soooooo borrrrrrrrrrring.  	His archetypes, or cities, challenge all kinds of fascinating studies on the meaning hidden behind the walls of what is viewed as regular necessities for survival. He describes Ersilia as a place where relationships to sustain city life are drawn by strings, white or black or gray or black-and-white, connected from the corners of houses. As the strings become too multitudinous and the city can no longer operate, everything is abandoned but the strings. A traveler might come upon the ghost town of this city, but find no ghosts, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spider-webs of intricate relationships seeking a form. 	A city called Zoe he explores, a place where every building is the same, the features of the city are “indistinguishable,” he hits a metaphysical problem, in essence, the thesis of this long stint into made-up, “invisible cities”: if existence in all its movements is all of itself, Zoe is the place of indivisible existence. But why, then, does the city exist? What line separates the inside from the outside, the rumble of wheels from the howl of wolves? What he is trying to extract from this discussion of cities between two fantasized historical figures and an extensive travelogue of fantastic cities is why do people build cities? What is the impetus for people to express themselves by living within a community; and by building with architecture and method?	Playing an elaborate game of pretend, in which he imagines in every passage a new city to characterize through a specific irregularity the trait he is exploring. This settling on a theme, rather than a confluence of the story, seems to me more appropriate to poetry, no? In poetry, you can explore the city by dwelling on a subject rather than letting the subjects move around as in a narrative. These are portraits of cityscape, a portrait might tell a thousand words but it is the viewer’s job to find the story. He tries to bring out the story prematurely, by carrying on this dumb journey by Marco Polo, as if that had a context. He’d be better off exploring within the abstract voice of “Marco”, but not with the voice of a traveling guide, but an explorer. In fact just exploring the mind, illustrating portraits of his crazed infatuation for the city and the subsequent imagination that comes from identifying purposes of the city, assessing certain “what ifs?” 	That isn’t to say that he doesn’t do this successfully, at times. This passage I thought was pretty key in establishing the beauty of one of the central themes here, a city’s history foraging for its forgotten past:  your footsteps follow not what is outside the eyes, but what is within, buried, erased. If, of two arcades, one continues to seem more joyous, it is because thirty years ago a girl went by there, with broad, embroidered sleeves, or else it is only because that arcade catches the light at a certain hour like that other arcade, you cannot recall where. Death is key in the establishment of where cities come from. His visit to the city of Adelma, one of the cities of the dead, encounters questions of the past that are not easily answered: You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask. He makes up a city of everyone you have ever known, and fronts the innate possibility that at one point the dead will outnumber the living. This sort of haunting grace characterizes the identity of this particular city, a personal threat to a life lived characterized by the elements of what this personal hell could be like: I could not take my eyes off them; if I turned my gaze just a little toward the crowd that crammed those narrow streets, I was assailed by unexpected faces, reappearing from far away, staring at me as if demanding recognition, as if to recognize me, as if they had already recognized me.  He is a ghost of his own memories, transferred into a city of his pasts, living through an adornment of his forgotten understandings and having to live with revisiting the impossibility of remembrance. The way it is written, it is just a city, but as all cities have the magic of enchantment so do his potential cities have the magic of making ideas come to life, of making a city of your memories, regrets, fears, and joys.	The brilliant part of his writing is that not every city is written as a personal inference, sometimes they are just acknowledging the possibilities of what a city could be, what it could do. The metaphor may be dead-pan: What makes Argia different from other cities is that it has earth instead of air. The streets are completely filled with dirt, clay packs the rooms to the ceiling on every stair another stairway is set in negative, over the roofs of the houses hangs layers of rocky terrain like skies with clouds. We do not know if the inhabitants can move about the city, widening the worm tunnels and the crevices where roots twist: the dampness destroys people’s bodies and they have scant strength; everyone is better off remaining still, prone; anyway, it is dark. 	From up here, nothing of Argia can be seen; some says, ‘it’s down below there,’ and we can only believe them. The place is deserted. At night, putting your ear to the ground, you can sometimes hear a door slam.	In essence, the book carries a lot of fantastic notions, insinuating that cities have the power to hold the answers to questions that we can not. Maybe it should have been told as a folk song, or groups of folk songs, rather than an almanac of interesting traits.",2008-02-18 03:43:41,3,en,2008-02-18 03:43:41,2,2008,0.00157,0.0001,0.00021,0.00012,0.00021,0.00016,1664
V Mignon,"Amusing, that I would end up reading two books this year with ""Invisible"" in the title. The first, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, about a man trying to find his place in American culture. The other, Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, about Kublai Khan and Marco Polo discussing the different cities Polo has visited. They couldn't be any more different. There's a connection to be made, though. Both novels depict the cities that are formed by its inhabitants. And both novels appear to state that visibility is dependent upon a boundary-eluding quality: that for Ellison, visibility is in direct opposition of the definite terms outside people place upon us and for Marco Polo, it is the people outside of him who implement defining elements to the cities he tells stories about. To exist with the dream intact; it was the very Urgeschichte Walter Benjamin discussed in his Expose of 1935, our primal history that is always crawling up between the cracks on the streets of our metropolises. We are, at all times, existing in, ""the jam of past, present, future that blocks existences calcified in the illusion of movement,"" as Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan. I have often been told that Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities is about the power of imagination. I would disagree with that. I believe that Calvino's novel is difficult to capture in a statement as simple as such. It is about the city, all chaos and construction and complexity included. Invisible Cities is about the power of the outsider's imagination and, intrinsically, the nature of a story-teller. ""'I speak and speak,' Marco says, 'but the listener only retains the words he is expecting . . . It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""I am fond of stories about the city, but this is probably completely evident by now. There are so many subjects to cover when we talk about our experiences with cities that it creates some of the most interesting writing. Everyone has their favorite setting. For some, it is the rural country-side, where there is a spectrum ranging from daily life to southern gothic. For others, it is the suburbs. For me, it is the city. I blame all the 80's science-fiction films I watched as a child. Watching Blade Runner and Escape From New York and Brazil, there was something truly alluring about the future cities presented. What I did not realize at the time was that these films depicted the ""nightmare city."" But how could they be nightmare cities when they were my dream cities? In Invisible Cities, some cities are dream cities. Other cities are nightmare cities. But ultimately, they are all the same city. They are all cities, which takes us into Jorge Luis Borges territory. Because in the end, all cities run on only two feelings: fear and desire. The most primal parts of our existences. Why is it that our cities are based on these sensations of survival? As Marco Polo tells a story about a certain city, he says it's, ""an approximate reflection, like every human creation."" In short, we are Urgeschichte. We are the primal past that we perpetually recreate. The walls and structure that we create are just accessories, perhaps like our stories. Marco Polo, an avid story-teller and traveler, recreates the cities he has visited for the great Kublai Khan, which immediately begs one to question the setting of this story. We start with a fabrication. By the end, you will have read about the anachronistic technology Polo has witnessed. Invisible Cities tells you at the very beginning that this is the work of the imagination and that factual evidence is of no concern. It is not a conventional novel. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan have moments of communication - sometimes by pantomiming, as they don't share the same language, but sometimes by language. There are large segments in which Polo describes the cities he has visited, categorized in different groups: Cities and memory, Cities and desire, Cities and signs, Thin cities, Trading cities, Cities and eyes, Cities and names, Cities and the dead, Cities and the sky, Continuous cities, and Hidden cities. And each city carries the name of a woman. Is it a story then? Yes and no. It depends on what you define as a story, as you are the outsider reading Calvino's novel. Invisible Cities can be seen as didactic, but I enjoy a novel that knows what its prerogative is. And there are many essays that I have read where they blur the line between academic writing and creative writing. Rem Koolhaas comes to mind. It's entirely possible that you will read like me, excited at the very fact that the word ""city"" has been coupled with ""desire"" and ""names."" These are ping words in my territory. And it's also possible that you will open this book and feel nothing for the words within. Ah, the creative field, how subjective you can be! Indeed, the power of Marco Polo's imagination is quite grand. There are images within this book that are difficult to forget. Streets that are akin to the lines in your hand, staircases that are like the coils of a conch shell, strings attached to people and their memories as floating and sentient beings, cities that recreate themselves every morning, ""the charring of burned lives that forms a scab on the city, the sponge swollen with vital matter that no longer flows . . ."" These are all very short glimpses of cities unknown to us, a tasting of one's imagination. The city Chloe took my breath away, as it reminded me of Angela Carter's The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman: ""A voluptuous vibration constantly stirs Chloe, the most chaste of cities. If men and women began to live their ephemeral dreams, every phantom would become a person with whom to begin a story of pursuits, pretenses, misunderstandings, clashes, oppressions, and the carousel of fantasies would stop."" Often, the beauty of Calvino's writing lulls one into a fantasy. Our cities are our fantasies, though. Do we not dream of new beginnings in the city, of new connections, of new lovers? Do our eyes not roam through the crowds, as the people of Chloe do, searching for a gaze that connects only to disconnect the next second? It is a strange existence, to be connected and not connected at the same time. Connectivity seems to be Polo's goal by the end. He speaks of the inferno of life, ""that we form by being together."" Polo describes how to escape suffering in the inferno: ""The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."" It's easy to read this as how one relates to other people, that you find the few who are not ""inferno"" and keep them close to you. This is not how I read this last paragraph, though.In Benjamin's Expose of 1935, the city and merchandise are explored. Benjamin states explicitly, ""World exhibitions are places of pilgrimage to the commodity fetish."" In discussing our need to buy, buy, buy, Benjamin reveals that consumerist culture opens, ""a phantasmagoria in which a person enters in order to be distracted. The entertainment industry makes this easier by elevating the person to the level of the commodity. He surrenders to its manipulations while enjoying his alienation from himself and others."" Materiality is not inherently evil. In fact, it is these objects that hold a lost fantasy that connects us to our primal past, our Urgeschichte. However, this changes when capitalism takes over and sells dreams to us. As opposed to us fulfilling our dreams through objects. Companies are no longer selling objects, they're selling lifestyles. They're selling fantasies. They want you to fall asleep and simply buy. But Benjamin insists that we must wake up instead and fulfill our dreams on some level. Dream, but do not be deluded.In this way, what Polo insists we seek out is emotional authenticity. In a world of symbols and names and products that deceive the eye, one must always stay vigilant. One must also always be apprehensive of our need to consume. And that is how we will connect with others, because when we seek out emotional authenticity from our articles and atmosphere, we will seek it out in people as well. Or at least, we will be more aware of what is authentic. Near the end of Invisible Cities, Kublai Khan brings out his atlas and insists that Marco Polo point out the cities he is describing. Polo tells Khan that he cannot find any of the cities on the atlas. In fact, ""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distance, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name."" When we define, we separate. When we think beyond definition, suddenly everything appears to be the same. This is Polo showcasing the power of imagination over the physical details. How are all the cities the same city? Because we are only human and build human cities. If you accept that one city is all cities, then no city can be one city. Thus, you free your mind of limitations and the preconceived notion that we are anything more than human.",2012-06-28 08:08:48,5,en,2012-06-28 08:08:48,6,2012,0.00067,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,1609
Drkshadow03,"The book is a series of vignettes in which Marco Polo describes strange and imaginary cities he has visited—or maybe it’s better to say imagined—to Kublai Khan. The cities are diverse and extraordinary including cities where they hang up strings of different colors from door to door to represent different social relationships, cities hanging on spiderwebs of cables and rope, cities surrounded by rubbish heaps of its past that threatens to fall upon it like an avalanche, cities of the dead where people occupy the same roles and jobs underneath cities of the living, cities where men fight endless wars with insects and vermin and commit genocide against them, cities where each group considers itself more righteous than the next,cities hidden within cities, cities with no boundaries which stretch everywhere and nowhere, cities that cannot be found except at a distance.Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan about different cities draws a parallel to Scheherazade in One Thousand and One Nights. Just as stories stave off death and bring about new relationships, the cities bring about philosophical pondering about the meaning of life, our choices, and the human experience.At one point, Marco Polo tells Khan that every city he describes is really in some way about Venice, his home city. We are always a product of where we came from and it always colors our perspective. Meanwhile Khan embodies the irony of controlling a vast empire of cities and cultures, yet never fully possessing them since he has never seen them in person and only hears of them secondhand through others’ reports or stories. Indeed, he feels an intense existential angst over his ability to finally possess his empire, finally come to understand it. He also feels angst over trying to understand if the cities Marco Polo tells him about are real or just imaginary.Kublai Khan comes to think that chess is a metaphor for grasping the meaning of life, but then Marco Polo begins discoursing on where the wood came which hints and refers to other stories, things, and ideas. When we think. We have finally pinned down a thing, come to its ultimate meaning, it eludes us in the end.“ The quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood overwhelmed Kublai; Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows. . . . (132).”The many cities contain endless paradoxes and contradictions. The boundaries are amorphous just like life and meaning, every final determination is elusive.A city’s past can only be understood by its present, while its present can only be understood by its past. So it is with our lives. Cities represent possibilities. They symbolize the choices we make. One choice prevents the possibility of other choices and the existence of other cities. The study of cities is really the study of people and their stories, and the study of ourselves. They represent what is the same and different among all people. They represent the imaginary and the real. They represent what could have been, what actually is, and how we experienced it. They represent the past, present, and future.In a typically Calvino way, the tale also raises the issue of the boundaries between the imaginary and reality. The frame story itself ends up being a philosophical debate about imagination and storytelling. Kublai Khan and Marco Polo begin to wonder if their refuge where they talk about strange imaginary cities away from war and the everyday concerns of being a merchant are an imaginary refuge they each use to shelter themselves from the harshness of their real lives, an escapism, or if their life of battle and being a merchant is the imaginary fiction and it is their sheltered refugee that is real. It plays with the boundaries of what is real and what is imaginary. Are our real lives really a series of fictions in which we only remember certain details and embellish others to give it meaning? Thus what is real is often more imaginary then we give credit.The ending turns to city as metaphor for the future. What future cities will arise? Kublai Khan fears we are destined for an infernal city—for hell. Marco retorts that there are two choices: most will choose the first and become accustomed to evil and suffering, learning to no longer see the infernal city, but others will find what is good in the world and society and this can be cultivated and increased so that the future is a brighter place.",2022-07-08 03:59:24,3,en,2022-07-08 03:59:24,7,2022,0.00111,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00017,763
Michael Percy,"In How to Read and Why, Harold Bloom writes that Invisible Cities is worthy of being read and re-read, and is one of the best short story works of the twentieth century by the ""fabulist"" Italo Calvino. Bloom suggests that Calvino is Borgesian and Kafkan. The connecting thread is a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, with Polo describing the cities he has visited, so the Great Khan can know better his crumbling empire. Bloom says of Calvino's wisdom (a recurring compliment from the great critic) that:Calvino's advice tells us again how to read and why: be vigilant, apprehend and recognise the possibility of the good, help it to endure, give it space in your life.The cities described are apparently all versions of Venice, with Kublai Khan later recognising this and trying to describe instead the cities to Polo. An endless chess game becomes a vehicle to describe the cities using the pieces and the board as metaphors. A ""fabulist"" is ""a person who composes or relates fables"". What I found most interesting about these (at times) very short stories is the way they are arranged (or scattered, as Bloom writes) around themes of thin cities, trading cities, dead cities, the sky, even fanciful cities such as Brave New World and Yahooland. Within the descriptions, there are numerous anachronisms: motorcycles, aircraft, steamships, and so on. But these never interrupt the reader and provide a connection with the present. The combination of fanciful and mystical characters who appear in the cities (for example, a woman who milks the carcass of a cow) are echoed in Gabriel García Márquez's work, but there is a difference. Márquez was regarded as a ""magical realist"", whereas Calvino's Invisible Cities is less realist and more like a series of fairy tales. I noticed myself drifting off into fantasy with the mystical imagery and the slipperiness of time; not in the J.R.R. Tolkien sense of fantasy, but an older, classical, Brothers Grimm-like fantasy land that repeatedly connects the past with the present and indeed the future. This work is more serious in tone than Palomar or Marcovaldo, but it still has their mystical qualities. I must admit to experiencing a sense of peace while reading this work, and although some aspects have a darker quality, I couldn't help but think of <a>Don Draper's pitch for Lucky Strike in Mad Men:Advertising is based on one thing, happiness, its reassurance that whatever you are doing, it’s OK, you are OK.Of course, Bloom (How to Read and Why, pp. 62-64) has more academic things to say about Calvino, but for me, one actually experiences his stories. In trying to articulate Calvino's style more clearly, I turned to the Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel and found that Calvino is described as a ""post-modernist"", and that Le città invisibili has (p. 174):...closer affinities to the allegory of the Middle Ages than to the realist novel.An allegory is a story:...that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one.I suppose this is what Harold Bloom means by the lessons we can learn from Calvino's wisdom. But even as an aside to read intermittently, the mystical qualities of the short stories provide sufficient space from reality for the reader to rejuvenate, to think, to imagine, and to dream, even just for a moment. This mystical quality is what I admire most about Calvino, and I am pleased to have stumbled upon Marcovaldo in a <a>Shanghai bookstore a few years ago that led me to take this journey with the great post-modern Italian master.",2018-10-24 20:35:22,3,en,2018-10-24 20:35:22,10,2018,0.00095,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,596
Steve,"Before I begin my review of this book, let me start by saying that my feelings towards this work varied wildly during my reading of it. What began with boredom and frustration suddenly relented and changed, almost imperctibly at first, to admiration and a sense of a promise fulfilled. If you, like me, were turned off initially by the plotless-ness of the book and its repetitive nature, I ask you to keep reading until the end. By this point, the poetic writing, surreal imagery, and pieces of valuable wisdom will have overturned your aversion to its ambiguous nature. The repition of “this city does this and oh this city does that, etc, etc” vexed me in the beginning until I realized not to pay attention to all of the details. Don’t memorize the names or their relation to each other and don’t look for a plot - let the words and ideas wash over you just as the smoke from Kublai Khan and Marco Polo’s pipes slowly drifts away before evaporating into the night air. If you approach it from a logical direction you will only frustrate yourself as I did at first. It is like trying to approach and analyze dreams (sorry you psychoanalysts out there) with anything more than passing fancy - it is fruitless and counter-productive. Experience them, hold on to that feeling, and then move on. This might seem counter-instinctual to many readers, myself included, so I would refer people to the scene from A New Hope in which Obi-Wan is giving Luke Skywalker his first lesson in using the force (this may or may not be the nerdiest analogy I’ve used in awhile) - Obi-Wan instructs Luke, after placing an obscuring visor over his eyes, “...let go your conscious self and act on instinct.” For all you S, T, or J Myers-Briggs or Han Solo types out there, feel free to eye roll and vomit at my last statement. I suppose a similar/better analogy is meditation in which one is supposed to regonize their thoughts and feelings and let them pass freely. Returning to the problem of repition in this book, there is a point approximately halfway through in which Kublai Khan discerns that Marco Polo is really describing one city, his Venice. But really, he is describing all cities, real or imagined, because they are displaying different characteristics of not only urban life in the 13th century, but the human condition and experience in general - birth, life, death, aging, memory, the good, the bad, just and unjust, our wishes and designs vs entropy and the passage of time. All of these themes coalesce by the end and the cities and their names are ultimately interchangeable and irrelevant. What we are left with are the questions that they have inspired.All that being said, describing this book is ultimately difficult as it functions similarly to a mirror - each person has their own unique point of view, history, memories, and sense of perception and will have different images reflected back at them. Additionally, even the same person might have a different reading of the book if read at different points in their life (I’ll have to test this theory if I were to ever read it again). As Marco Polo states “I speak and speak but the listener only retains the words he is expecting...It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”First 50 pages: 2/5; Next 100 pages: 4/5Final rating: 3.5/5P.S. Although quite a few of these cities were forgettable, a number of them could be expanded and provide the basis of many interesting locations for fantasy or sci-fi fiction (I’m looking at you city with a million snow globe models of all the possible cities that the city could have become).",2019-03-14 07:32:22,4,en,2019-03-14 07:32:22,3,2019,0.00715,0.00011,0.00045,0.00017,0.0005,0.00024,632
Marty Reeder,"Having loved some of Italo Calvino’s short stories, I searched out his novels. If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler … began with so much beautiful promise before spiraling into irrelevance and then repulsion. It made me take a long pause, a very long pause, before reading the other of his books that I bought: Invisible Cities. When I finally did read it, I did so thinking that If on a Winter’s Night … faltered, perhaps, because of the gimmick upon which it was founded (a novel in 2nd person). Without that issue, could not this clearly super talented author accomplish great things?! Invisible Cities would be that test.A test which it failed.I started it and felt that my original instincts had been right: here was a genius writer presenting thoughtful ideas in ways that no other writer could even pretend to mimic. But the deeper into the novel I got, each chapter became more repetitive--not in content, mind you, the whole structure of Invisible Cities is based on super unique chapters, but in meaningless explorations of “fresh” perspectives on life, society, and the world we are apart of.While on their own, each chapter serves as an unparalleled sample of pensive, original, and naturally gifted writing, their successive placement reveals how truly meaningless they really are, regardless of the talent that it took to sculpt them. As Calvino reaches for ever more “fresh” perspectives, where he eschews limits of decency on occasion as he would eschew a traditional plot, he manages to place the reader in a paradox: how is it that I can recognize how immensely talented and aware Calvino is as a writer, and yet find no ultimately lasting pleasure from his innovative works?I wonder if I could venture a hypothesis. Most of the preeminent authors in the history of literature are both talented at the craft of writing, while able to capture truths of life from the characters and situations in their stories. Italo Calvino is clearly a master of the writing craft. Perhaps, there is no one more skilled at finding and arranging the magical words and phrases he uses to build up an idea or unique concept. Yet, while the Truth that he explores in his literature has the appearance of richness, it is actually gilded nothingness. The philosophies he taps into seem deep but are really just shallow. His god is the God of Literature. As a fan of literature, you would think I might subscribe to this sort of thing, but I guess I realize that I am actually looking for a God of Life … and appreciate the ability of great literature to reveal that to me--literature as the magnanimous means rather than the end.Halfway through, I had no compelling reason to continue reading and other priorities took over. Every now and then, I’d see it and think. I should finish. It’s short and at least well written. But after dabbling with a chapter or two, I set it down again.Finally, at the end of last year, I thought enough was enough. I needed to clean up all my reading loose ends. I finished Beatrice and Virgil by Yann Martel, which has surprising similarities to Invisible Cities yet with much more authentic depth. Now, two days later, I wrapped up Invisible Cities. While I appreciated the final line managing to tie the autonomous chapters under some sort of collective meaning, I was more relieved than satisfied to be able to check this off the list. Calvino will find me continuing to search out his short stories, where his talented writing will not be burdened by higher expectations of genuine meaning and purpose, but I gave his novels a try and both left me far more apathetic (or disgusted) than great writing should.",2020-01-09 00:25:27,1,en,2020-01-09 00:25:27,1,2020,0.00095,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,630
Hriday,"Book Review: Invisible Cities: Spoilers all aroundOK, this one is going to be a bit of a jeremiad, but I really can’t help it. This was pure pain. Even as I write this I can imagine a Biblical guy named Jeremiah sitting on a mound of one of Calvino’s cities and yowling and howling at a full moon a la Junglebook with Mowglee, Akru and Pakru and pack. Also, since this is a review of Invisible Cities I am going to imagine that in 50 different ways and disguise it and tell it some Emperor. It is essentially a series of narrations by Marco Polo who describes 50 odd invisible imaginary cities to Kublai Khan which are all in essence different renditions of his home town Venice. ( The number might be less than 50 but there just seemed to be an interminable number of 1 page chapters about some city with some apparently wondrous feature.)The reason I picked up this book was the fact that I had read “The Soft Moon”, an amazing heart rending story of Calvino’s from Cosmicomics a rather avant garde work of his. Even as I write this I am aware Calvino is among the greatest of the modern era and I hope to be astounded by some other work of his but I clearly did not like this one.There are some books which everyone praises because everyone else praises them whilst reading them is an aching nuisance; this book lies firmly in this category.Now that I have vented, I think I have regained enough composure to write with more sobriety. The first critique that I can offer is that this work lacks a plot, it reads more like the memoirs of a cartographer’s or urban planner’s meticulous assistant in the sense that it is detailed, intricate, well imagined and etched out but thoroughly uninteresting.Perhaps the writer has a deeper, layered meaning behind all his meandering descriptions of cities from Oxiana to China. But one needs both time and intellect to figure out the same. For the lack of the first I can certainly be faulted. For the second I am willing to admit the possibility I am an imbecile yet I wish the author had been wise enough to write down to the plebeian masses like me discounting for our lack of discernment.Thirdly, while I admit, the prose is lapidary and maintains a sort of moon like shimmer I think the purpose and intent of the work remain impenetrable; at least to someone as knuckleheaded as me. Perhaps the lack of comprehension has something to do with living in the prosaic city of New Delhi as opposed to Venice which is mythologised in this work. Perhaps it might also have something to do with the fact that I had not read any reviews of this work prior to reading the book (maybe unlike some of my more liberal fellow reviewers), but I am again willing to discount that possibility.Fourthly, for me, any work has to have its characters evolve and have their souls laid bare by fire for the work to have any meaning. Here we have Marco Polo and Kublai Khan waffling on about imaginary cities. Nowhere do we see struggles or inner battles except in a most perfunctory manner akin to a spectator sport. You can throw all the Derrida Sherrida, Baudrillard and Lyotard and postmodernism at me of how the text is being written all the time but with my limited patience, perception, pliancy and also my limited French I am going to pass that one. Merci beaucoup( I doubt anyone would read all the way till here. If you are here, thank you!)P.S. I am going to give this one 3 stars and not 1 star, as I don’t want to risk being torn apart by the culture police.",2017-10-21 09:22:53,2,en,2017-10-21 09:22:53,10,2017,0.00134,0.0001,0.00021,0.0001,0.00022,0.00015,639
Shailendra Gautam,"Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.
This book accompanied me on few of my travels in India. Each chapter is no longer than 2-3 pages and each contains description of a city as seen and experienced by Marco Polo and as told to Kiblai Khan, successor of Changez Khan.It is worth noting that although Marco Polo had travelled a lot and had met Kiblai Khan, this is a purely fictional take. Marco Polo's claims have been contested in the past and many beleive he never visited the places he claimed to have visited. We also see this in the book but explored in a more creative manner.There are all kinds of cities the book mentions. Some will remind you of a city you've travelled to in the past, while some will remind of your hometown. And as you flip through the pages, you ask yourself whether the cities exist in reality or only in one's imagination?
  POLO: Unless porters, stonecutters, rubbish collectors, cooks cleaning the lights of chickens, washerwomen bent over stones, mothers stirring rice as they nurse their infants, exist only because we think them.KUBLAI: To tell the truth, I never think them.POLO: Then they do not exist.
Later in the book Polo admits that he only talks about Venice, that Venice becomes a different city based on your point of view. Later, Kiblai would fabricate a city and ask Polo whether it exists. Soon, the two begin to form cities by their thoughts, or by broken pieces of some city they remember.
  And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”
As I was reading the book and the cities, it dawned on me that maybe the book is not about the cities at all, it's about people. Each city is a person, as there is a city caught between past and present, there is a city which follows it's image, soon the image follows it, there is a city with too many gods, some cities abandoned, some fertile. Each having its own personality.
  Intent on piling up its carats of perfection, Beersheba takes for virtue what is now a grim mania to fill the empty vessel of itself; the city does not know that its only moments of generous abandon are those when it becomes detached from itself, when it lets go, expands.And to feel sure of itself, the living Laudomia has to seek in the Laudomia of the dead the explanation of itself, even at the risk of finding more there, or less: explanations for more than one Laudomia, for different cities that could have been and were not, or reasons that are incomplete, contradictory, disappointing.
What I enjoyed in this book is how some cities resembled the places I've visited. Everytime Polo would describe a city, an image would form in my head from places I've been to, it's insane that for each chapter I was able to imagine a city.
  ""I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting...It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""
In the end, my favorite was the city on the coast, situated between a desert and a sea, viewed from the land you see it as a city that leads to the sea but if you view it from the sea, it suddenly becomes a city that leads you to the land. It had a name but I forgot it and only remember the image it created in my head, of a city with houses painted white overlooking the sea, with sailors looking at it from the harbour thinking about its taverns, while a traveller approacing it from the desert is listening to a distant sound of the waves washing up on its shores.

Nathan Albright,"This is an odd book, but it's an odd book in the best possible way.  Set in the past, specifically during the time of Marco Polo and his travels to the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan in what is now China, this is a volume that explores the reality and imagination of cities.  The titular invisible cities are generally imaginary in nature, and there is both enough variety in the cities being described and enough coherence in the frame story that weaves the stories of these cities together to make the book a fascinating exploration of urban life as imagined by a very odd and very obviously urban Italian.  The author seems to hint that whatever sameness we feel about our cities is due to either a failure of observation in seeing what distinct and quirky elements are there or a failure of imagination in picture the diversity of cities that could possibly exist and settling for imitations and copies of other cities rather than the forming of unique and individual forms.  Either way, this book suggests that if we fault cities for being too dull and monotonous that the fault lies in ourselves and that we could have it better if we wanted it to be.The book itself is a short one of a bit more than 150 pages.  The book is divided into nine parts, each of which begins and ends with a dialogue of some kind between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in which the Mongol emperor seeks some level of certainty about his struggling emperor and cannot manage to keep up with the fecundity of Polo's imaginative description about cities that are hidden, continuous, connected to the sky and the dead, thin, related to eyes and desire and signs and trading and names and memory.  Over 50 cities are imagined by the author, each of them told in a short series of passages that is a page or two (or sometimes a bit more than two pages) long, giving some sort of fascinating hint as to what the city is like with Polo ultimately being unable to truly understand the cities but at least glimpsing their nearly infinite variety and Kublai Khan being unable even to grasp this, not even able to guess where Polo would go next or create a city that Polo had not seen or imagined before.  The result is a fascinating book about the problem of cities and of human life as a whole.Of course, this book does not discuss cities perfectly.  There is no discussion here of the New Jerusalem, as all of the cities discussed are flawed cities with human failings, some of them endless cycles of rises and falls, some of them a certain je ne sais quoi that allows them to be remembered by people but ultimately forgotten by the earth.  In some of the discussions the author's displacement of the time of the story in the past allows him to imagine Marco Polo as a prophet telling the future of cities that are seemingly shapeless like Tokyo and Los Angeles and to make some sly jokes about his own future as a prisoner having his stories recorded by the slightly unreliable author of adventure stories who happens to be in the same cell.  In some cases, some of the details the author makes have puzzling and humorous resonance the author could not have known about, like his reference to a city where women walk pumas on leashes, which the author may have viewed scenes like the ""Starboy"" music video where the singer walks a panther of some kind on a leash.  Regardless, though, there is much to ponder about and much to enjoy in this book and in its portrayal of cities and their importance to us.",2019-01-06 02:03:54,5,en,2019-01-06 02:03:54,1,2019,0.0008,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,629
Joel,"There’s a cyclicalness to the world that makes us uncomfortable. We in the west prefer to think that things are neatly stacked, one idea upon another in a glorious edifice of success; eschewing the crumbling waste which is not to last as it disintegrates away leaving the foundations solid and enduring, mortared as they are by the good qualities of upright men.Civilization, we call it – the abiding construction ever upwards in a richness unto glory.But things are not lasting, not eternal nor stable. They rise and fall and rise again – like the cities of Italo Calvino’s novel “Invisible Cities”.Worse still, things are not even consistent. Like Calvino’s cities – Kublai Khan’s surprise that his guest is just describing Venice over and over and over; future and past, wealth and ruin, death and rebirth, destruction and renewal; the traveler afraid to say the name of his own home: “Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased (…). Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.” We are all afraid of losing our home; afraid to say the names of the things which we love lest they fade away, ephemeral in the light we shine upon them. And we too are afraid to speak about what it is that we love, lest our enemies notice that which is in our hearts and target their evil toward its destruction.As if they already don’t; already aren’t.The irony is not lost on me that I came to learn of Calvino’s masterpiece in an article about Aleppo – that oldest of Mesopotamian cities. That place where Abraham milked his sheep to feed the poor. Important in the Babylonian Empire, the Assyrian as well – the Amorites and the Hittites and the Persians. The capital of Sham; the center of civilizations rising and falling and recurring. The end of Kublai Khan’s silk road; visited by Marco Polo to be sure, and described to the Khan in all its ancient glory.“Aleppo has fallen” – how many times has that gravid phrase been repeated since the misty days of prehistory? From the days when writing was done upon clay taken from the Queiq River using a stylus carved perhaps from wood taken from the ancient forests of Lebanon. Will it rise again, after its recent destruction? Time will tell.Yes, history rises and falls – and it is for those of us who fear to utter the names of our own cities, lest they too fall away and are spoken of no more – to understand why, and to announce to the world that which is good and true and abiding.

The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”I, for one, do not accept the inferno – nor will I become a part of it.",2018-02-18 19:35:29,4,en,2018-02-18 19:35:29,2,2018,0.0019,0.00011,0.00021,0.00013,0.00022,0.00022,572
Richard Buro,"The short version first . . . Most books about the cities, towns, and villages of a European country are factual, informative, and provide some guidance to the new traveler about services, amenities, and attractions for most cities, towns, and villages of a country you plan to visit. This book is less factual and more fanciful; however, it has its merits as well. This work is entitled Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino with translations provided translator/author William Weaver.Invisible Cities is written as a series of vignettes relating conversations between Marco Polol and Kublai Khan. They are discussing the various towns, villages, and larger population concentrations in the larger cities of the mid- to late 16th Century in many areas supposedly located in Southern and Eastern Europe. In the relatively short treatise, dozens of towns are mentioned with a description of the good features and those not quite so appealing. Invisible Cities is, for the most part, a review of the characteristics of each location with no more than 3 pages devoted to most, if not all, of the towns mentioned. While the work is not quite a perfect travelouge, it does provide the reader with some interesting insights into the basically rough-and-tumble aspects of all of the hamlets, villages, towns, and cities noted. It reminds one of a Rand McNally Travelouge, or a similar treatise with quick descriptions, vignettes, and unusual aspects of each location noted.Invisible Cities was a 1976 best for the Nebula Award for best novel. It was also one of finalists in 1975 for excellence in translation. These acknowledgements from the sci/fi - fantasy community indicates that the work has superior quality in both writing and translation, and while it did not win, its two nominations are highly enough ranked to warrant due consideration to the time it takes to read a book of this length. When even a slower reader like me, can breeze through it in an after in the winter in Central Texas, it can't be too shabby, not at all!This was a book nominated as a monthly read in the Goodreads All About Books reading group. It was a good read and it matched up nicely with my understanding of the conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, fanciful though they may be. Still, they appear to be somewhat plausible, and it made for a nice read.Recommendations:This is a 4 out of 5 stars for me. I found a handful of minor errors sprinkled throughout, some words misspelled, and a couple of words that did not sound right in context, but it was hard to nail them down to specifics -- in one read through, they sounded correct; but. in the second. third and fourth reviews, something that I could not pin down completely just didn't sound right. Regardless, it is light fanciful, and worth an afternoon spent with a good book, especially if you are waiting for information that your are hoping goes a certain way. It did keep my mind busy.I would consider this book fine for use with upper middle- and certainly high school and beyond grade levels for you school librarians or teachers out there.",2019-01-25 13:49:26,5,en,2019-01-25 13:49:26,1,2019,0.00059,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,526

Tom,"TL;DR - A work that strives for profundity and largely hits the mark. The book offers an extended session of pondering the position one takes moment to moment in a new space, suggesting how that space can fold in all the places you've been and all the places you've yet to beCalvino's work imagines Marco Polo in the court of Kublai Khan, acting as a guide through the far reaches of a Khanate in decay (was it always that way?). This pair serves as the throughline throughout Polo's dreamy depictions of places that are everything at once: in ruin and ascendant, ever expanding and continually contracting, rife with plague and converting lazarettos into marketplaces. Their interactions are interstices for Polo's many cities, named either for imagined places or a woman's name. The reason Polo relates all these details isn't to precisely report the state of the empire, but to provide emblems for the Khan to imagine the cities themselves. Detail and depiction are not sufficient to understand a city, as there is no amount of description that can fully contain the entirety of its subject. Instead Polo is leaning on ""the power of emblems, which, once seen, cannot be forgotten or confused."" How successful are these emblems? It varies over the course of the work. Calvino does a wonderful job at times with turns of phrase that provoke thoughtful tangents. These punctuate evocative stories of cities, the imagined lives that could be had as an inhabitant, and the reality of only ever lingering a moment. Although these ponderings are always held at a distance, since the conveyance of these tales fully embraces the position of the visitor (the very first tale did a great job in establishing this premise). The emblematic moments of cities can come from their layouts, their twinning (the work is littered with pair after pair), their populace, what they contain, what they don't contain. These are very short depictions, so the heavy lifting comes from tidy turns that make most cities reductive to a few key thoughts.This is my type of book in that it leans into ridiculously precise words for certain descriptions (shout-outs to odalisque, filigree, and the aforementioned lazaretto), has lovely little moments that figuratively knock out the knees and enable contemplation of something that strikes my brain as essential, and (nearly) doesn't overstay its welcome. It does, however, run on a bit towards the end and gets a touch obsessed with the fluidity of space/time or some tedious paired opposite (the smoke-filled interstice with Khan and Polo sticks out; there's actually a rerun for a city of the dead and living but the twist is there's one for the yet-to-be as well, wow!!). If you do decide to pick up the book, I'd recommend doing only a Khan/Polo scene and chapter a day. It'll give the stories a little more room to breath and (I think) will alleviate the tedium of the last few chapters.",2018-08-24 08:55:15,4,en,2018-08-24 08:55:15,8,2018,0.00091,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,492
Jeff,"Invisible Cities is my introduction to Calvino outside an abortive reading of If on a winter's night a traveler, and more familiarity with his other writings could have made his goals in this book clearer and helped it read less like a very well executed creative writing assignment that never congeals into anything greater.Organized around a fictional dialogue between the explorer Marco Polo and the emperor Kublai Khan, the majority of the book is a collection of 50+ short (half a page to several pages long) descriptions of fictional, often metaphorical cities. Some of them are fantastic, such as a city built upon ropes, chains, and catwalks strung across a chasm, where ""the life of Octavia's inhabitants is less uncertain than in other cities. They know the net will last only so long."" For anyone who enjoys imagining a fictional setting, these highlights make the book worthwhile.Describing the city of Laudomia and its double, the city's graveyard, Calvino hits upon parallels: ""The streets of the Laudomia of the dead are just wide enough to allow the gravedigger's cart to pass, and many windowless buildings look out on them; but the pattern of the streets and the arrangement of the dwellings repeat those of the living Laudomia, and in both, families are more and more crowded together, in compartments crammed one above the other.""This is the kind of comparison you can make when you're being imaginatively and self-consciously philosophical - interesting to ponder, fun to talk about, but surface deep. Many of Calvino's other stories hit upon similar profundity, like the city of Trude that says: airports, they're all kind of the same, aren't they?The orientalism of the framing device is a little off-putting, but Calvino may have been trying to do something different by having the western explorer spin tales to the eastern emperor. Regardless, it isn't overbearing. The fact that each of the cities bears a woman's name is offputting, but usually overshadowed by the entertaining prose and Calvino's descriptive abilities.Wikipedia describes a structure to the layout of the thematically grouped city descriptions, but knowing it didn't add to my understanding or appreciation of the book. Calvino also clearly has an interest in semiotics, which I don't share but could have at least made the point of the book clearer (but maybe my concern with meta-textual justifications is in conflict with anyone deeply in love with semiotics and literature).The best and worst thing I can say about Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities is that it reads like second-rate Jorge Luis Borges. The creativity with (mis)categorization, metaphor, resemblance, and similitude are all there, but not the pathos and wit.",2019-09-28 13:48:37,3,en,2019-09-28 13:48:37,9,2019,0.00086,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,438
Carmen,"This is a fictional story of Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan of all the cities he's seen traveling around the empire. All the cities are made up and their descriptions are odd, imaginative, and dreamlike. It covers themes such as the cycle of birth and death, reflections and dualities, identities, and traveling. The writing style is flowy and poetic, and reminds me of Kundera and Kafka.Favorite quotes:""With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals everything else.""""You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.""""Contemplating these essential landscapes, Kublai reflected on the invisible order that sustains cities, on the rules that decreed how they rise, take shape and prosper, adapting themselves to the seasons, and then how they sadden and fall in ruins. At times he thought he was on the verge of discovering a coherent, harmonious system underlying the infinite deformities and discords, but no model could stand up to the comparison with the game of chess. Perhaps, instead of racking one's brain to suggest with the ivory pieces' scant help visions which were anyway destined to oblivion, it would suffice to play a game according to the rules, and to consider each successive state of the board as one of the countless forms that the system of forms assembles and destroys.""""It also happens that, if you move along Marozia's compact walls, when you least expect it, you see a crack open and a different city appear. Then, an instant later, it has already vanished. Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly. But everything must happen as if by chance, without attaching too much importance to it, without insisting that you are performing a decisive operation, remembering clearly that any moment the old Marozia will return and solder its ceiling of stone, cobwebs, and mold over all heads.""""[I]t is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy.

Dave Walsh,"This is one of those books that's hard to summarize.There's not much meat on the bones when it comes to story or characters. There's not much that changes or really pulls you in. For some readers, the idea of reading a page or two description of a strange, remote city will be enough to stoke their imaginations. The book is Kublai Khan and Marco Polo in a conversation. Khan has tasked Polo with visiting his empire and reporting back his findings, even though he has an atlas with each city meticulously detailed via images already. Polo perhaps never leaves or goes to these places, instead tells tales of far away lands that may or may not exist. A good number of them have women's names. That's it. There's no conflict, very little dialogue and only really the two characters. While short, this book took me a while to read. The first 50 or so pages flew by, then the rest crawled by. In a way, it reminded me of the first time I read Moby-Dick in college. That whole middle section about the whale? I skimmed and skipped my way through it to finish the book in time, knowing full well it had its purpose. For a lot of this book I found myself skimming, knowing I could always return to it later and perhaps will take more away from it when I'm in a mood to read meticulous descriptions of strange details.Not to say the descriptions aren't great. A particular favorite of mine was the city suspended by a net, everything strung up and hanging, knowing eventually the net would break and the city would be gone. There's a lot of artistry in this book, even if there isn't much story. There's a lot of metaphor to be gleaned from it as well. Khan, a conqueror who rules over a vast kingdom that he'll never get to see or know, to the point where Polo admits to most of his descriptions just being of his home city he misses dearly, or that he's making everything up to appease Khan. Still, Khan holds out hope. Polo is a captive who wishes to see these far off lands and can't, while Khan is a conqueror who supposedly has all of these things at his disposal but will never visit them. There are times, especially in the chapters with women's names, where it seems abundantly clear it's very much about a woman. The woman he can't penetrate deeper into the heart of and only knows the exteriors of. Gee, wonder what that's about. There's also talk about death, from cities of the dead, cities with dualities or that are broken up into two, Khan and Polo muse if they're alive or dead and there's even a chess board that has irregularities that Polo is able to explain to a curious Khan. Like I said, there's a lot to unpack in this dense little tome about the world, human nature, love and more, you just have to be in the right mood for it.",2021-01-26 02:40:59,4,en,2021-01-26 02:40:59,1,2021,0.00193,0.00011,0.00025,0.00012,0.00022,0.0002,511
Edmond,"I'm not sure if I really know what Invisible Cities even is, and I'm not quite sure Calvino would have wanted it to be defined so clearly anyway. Part fictitious travelogue part story, the book is actually quite remarkable. Having read it, I find in myself a shift in how I see the world. In our current modernity, we have been cursed, and the curse is the access to and the unbounded desire for exact, precise, and objective knowledge. Normally, this can be seen as a good thing, but in many ways, this has caused us to lose our pure subjectivity. Our experiences in the world has been filtered, mediated, through other people's collected knowledge. Instead of exploring and understanding things in our own terms, we see it through other people's lenses, understanding only through what people thought of it. What do I mean by this? I think the best example would, fittingly, be travelling. Having entered the city, one is often armed with a list of things to see and do, a list formed by others by what they think is worth seeing or doing. Instead of going around fresh-eyed, observing and interpreting the minutiae without distinction of what is important or not, we are shuttled around, by ourselves or by others, from one viewpoint to another. From the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre, we miss out on exploring the arrondissements in between. Constantly knowing where to go, we have lost the discussions with the locals, the miming, the invitations, the extremely personal history a person has with the location. Of course, with the way the world works these days, not only with the capitalist desire for high productivity having us constantly work without the ability to take extended breaks but also the consumerist desire to experience everything under the Sun (everything important, at least, where importance is assigned by others), it is difficult for many to actually experience travelling in this pure unmediated form. The book in itself is good, but not spectacular. The descriptions of some cities can be interpreted as a figurative description of reality, but some are so outlandish that they're not that interesting to read. Of course, they serve a purpose in the story, but there isn't much more than that. Some other descriptions seem like they can describe many cities you've been to, in a loose way that you've never thought of before. That exploration of someone else's subjectivity feels very satisfying. Of course, this exploration of subjectivity is quite deliberate by Calvino too — Polo's conversation with Genghis on Venice illustrates exactly that. With this in mind, I think Calvino had accomplished what he had set out to do, rounding out what I must describe as a must read for people who enjoy exploring the world and their minds alike.",2021-11-16 19:52:25,4,en,2021-11-16 19:52:25,11,2021,0.00062,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,468
Joe Silber,"I first discovered Italo Calvino from his massive collection of Italian folktales (which I still haven't finished, although I have enjoyed the ones I've read). Invisible Cities is also a collection of stories, but quite different. The frame story involves explorer Marco Polo telling stories of fantastic cities he's visited to the great Kublai Khan. Each story (they are so short, they might be considered vignettes) focuses on a different fictional city, each given a woman's name. The stories do not have characters, per se; the city IS the character. In many cases, the cities are not possible; Calvino plays with philosophical and mathematical concepts and imagines, say, the city of Zora, which visitors remember every detail of by heart, or a city which perfectly maps the overhead stars, or Fedora, a city in which a museum houses models of every possible alternative version of the city that might have existed. Some of the stories are more about human nature; the story of the city of Zemrude, for instance, reflects on how visitors perceive it differently based on whether they look up, happily strolling along, or downward, with their eyes in the streets and gutter. In Melania, its citizens are caught up in endlessly repeating dialogues and roles - the braggart soldier, the foolish servant, and so on - and a visitor returning years later will find the roles still there but the players changed. Does Calvino mean you to interpret this literally or figuratively? It's hard to say. All told, there are some 55 (I think) vignettes, along with a number of intercalary sections describing the interactions between Polo and Kublai Khan. Each vignette is given a title and number, like ""Cities &amp; The Dead 2"" or ""Continuous Cities 5"" which in some way relates to the theme of the story (sometimes more clearly than others). Each theme is repeated a total of 5 times. Ultimately, this is a very literary, experimental book that reminds me of a cross between the stories of Jorge Luis Borges (mazes, infinities, etc) and a wonderful book called ""Einstein's Dreams"" by Alan Lightman that plays with notions of time and space in alternative realities. Calvino's prose is gorgeous, and I advise you not to blow through the stories too quickly. Each one is almost like a prose poem, and will not take you long to read. I suggest reading a few stories and then switching to something else for a bit, then returning. Despite the endless creativity of the stories, I found that very few of them stuck with me for long, and ultimately I didn't feel like the entire book held together completely as a unit, although I very much was glad to have read it. I suspect it rewards multiple re-readings, though.",2022-08-15 00:58:23,4,en,2022-08-15 00:58:23,8,2022,0.00086,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,461
Sébastien,"“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”
Invisible Cities by Italian writer Italo Calvino in 1972 and translated to English by William Weaver. Set as the conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, the readers get to explore the cities through the descriptions by Polo. In boundless imagination, I visited each city and envied the Venetian explorer.In this series of stories, fifty-five fictitious cities are told in intricately exquisite proses. These cities are divided into eleven categories of five each: Cities &amp; Memory; Cities &amp; Desire; Cities &amp; Signs; Thin Cities; Trading Cities; Cities &amp; Eyes; Cities &amp; Names; Cities &amp; the Dead; Cities &amp; the Sky; Continuous Cities; Hidden Cities. Through extravagantly elaborated narrative, the reader will learn each city and its geography, climate, culture, language, its people, etc. Polo's shares his experience and blends in his opinions about the cities while he reports to the great Mongol emperor.Reading this book is a very imaginative process. Well, reading itself is a work of imagination but as I read about each city, I am sauntering around the streets or sometimes soaring across the sky of these fictional cities. The ornate storytelling enhances the imagination experience, too. However, it also challenges me cause I find it confusing at some points. That could probably be my unfamiliarity with such complex narration.I picked this book after reading a short story of Ken Liu, the Bookmaking Habits of Select Species. It was a very interesting piece and hence, inquisitively (as usual) I looked up online and found an interview with the writer. Ken Liu said he referenced Calvino's narrative in Invisible Cities to write that story. It piqued my interest. From town to town, from one sea port to another, through mountains and valley, rivers and forests, I roam around these cities.Many regard this book as an a travelogue or a travel literature. Some consider that this is Polo's homage of his beloved city, Venice and some believe it is Calvino's representation of multi-faceted New York with fifty-five fabricated cities. For me, as much as I get the travel experience, I'd like to think Calvino's wrote 55 characteristics of different women partly because the names of all fifty-five cities are women's names. I could be deviating from the author's original intention. Regardless, it is quite a mesmerising journey you can have while you locked inside your house can can't travel anywhere.

E. C. Koch,"This kind of thing is neither for the faint of heart nor for the uninitiated of lit. theory. What Invisible Cities reads like is successive variations of Borges’ “On Exactitude in Science,” which means that it also constantly reads like Baudrillard’s Simulacra and Simulation, only weirder. The plot, such as it is, is a book-length conversation between Marco Polo – famed explorer and infamous artificer – and Kublai Khan – Mongol emperor and resident of Coleridge’s Xanadu. Here, Polo regales Khan with descriptions of distant cities, which both Khan and the reader suspect are fabrications (which, given that this is a novel, of course, they are). And this is the meat of the book, these one- to three-page gnomic descriptions of cities that sound to my ears like muted Borges. Were it not for the strength of On a winter’s night a traveler I might have dismissed this as unnecessarily opaque, but, opaque though it is, I still sense that there’s a there there. The invisible cities being explored here are those of memory and language (which, if you’re given to a particular reading, is just language) those twin poles of the then-revelatory new philosophy of poststructuralism. The signs used to discourse only function through difference, and so the ever-changing association we make with signs likewise alters signification and memory. And just in case you think that I’m overreading this, consider: “This—some say—confirms the hypothesis that each man bears in his mind a city made only of differences, a city without figures and without form, and the individual cities fill it up;” “As time went by, words began to replace objects and gestures in Marco’s tales: first exclamations, isolated nouns, dry verbs, then phrases, ramified and leafy discourses, metaphors and tropes;” “There is no language without deceit.” Akin to how other philosophically bent novels operate (e.g., The Stranger, Anthem, Also Spoke Zarathustra) I get the feeling like the tail is wagging the dog in that the idea, rather than the story, is in control, and so the message here appears to simply be an argument about how language, though ephemeral, can nevertheless build whole worlds (cites) that feel as real as a real city (because – and here’s the tough leap required of poststructuralism – ""real"" cities are just made of language) and thus the distinction between language and object (signifier and signified) disappears, leaving us with only signifiers. I’m afraid that the audience for this book is probably limited to a certain subset of graduate students whose insecurity is compensated for by talking about how much they love this book. I did not love this book.",2021-11-08 22:40:44,3,en,2021-11-08 22:40:44,11,2021,0.00166,0.0001,0.00023,0.00011,0.00021,0.00017,437
Sienna,"Work stops at sunset. Darkness falls over the building site. The sky is filled with stars. ""There is the blueprint,"" they say.
I am a big fan of the novel as thought experiment. As a philosophy-loving undergrad I discovered Serbian writer Milorad Pavić and fell for his playful approach to form. My favorite — and one of my favorite books, period — is The Dictionary of the Khazars, which exists in two editions, male and female, distinguished only by a single crucial sentence. It's more encyclopedia than dictionary but, like both of those texts, can be read out of sequence. Pavić always struck me as incurably curious, brave and masterful and funny, willing to make mistakes so long as they're accompanied by happy accidents. His books make me think. They also make me feel.
  It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.
Given my affection and respect for Pavić and fellow wor(l)d-wanderers like Borges, Calvino has been on my to-read list for years. His works rarely seem to wind up on secondhand shelves and apparently I can't be bothered to buy new versions, especially at New Zealand prices. My husband has a copy of If on a winter's night a traveler that I keep picking up at the wrong moments and abandoning. So, after more than a decade of intending to read Invisible Cities, having called four new cities home during that period, I finally downloaded the Kindle version I just knew I would love. That's the problem with expectations.I did love it, at times. Not having a physical copy feels strangely appropriate given the changeable nature of Marco Polo's Scheherazadean exchanges with Kublai Khan, the sense that any questions Calvino has written may have been uttered and answered or simply floated around in the mind of the traveler or the ruler, waiting to be wondered. Such ambiguous truth-values delight me.
  At this point Kublai Khan interrupted him or imagined interrupting him, or Marco Polo imagined himself interrupted, with a question such as: ""You advance always with your head turned back?"" or ""Is what you see always behind you?"" or rather, ""Does your journey take place only in the past?""All this so that Marco Polo could explain or imagine explaining or be imagined explaining or succeed finally in explaining to himself that what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveler's past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which each day that goes by adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.
(This reminded me of Constantine Cavafy's ""The City"": ""Always you will arrive in this city."" Actually, the whole book did.)I love thinking about how those shifting circumstances would change the asking. As usual, I love the idea of linking place and past through memory palaces. I love the notion of an unhappy city containing a happy city unaware of itself, even if it's absurd to group cities into such categories. And I love the language. Let's reach into my grab-bag of highlighted passages. Look how much Calvino can convey without language, and with it:
  Marco Polo could express himself only with gestures, leaps, cries of wonder and of horror, animal barkings or hootings, or with objects he took from his knapsacks — ostrich plumes, pea-shooters, quartzes — which he arranged in front of him like chessmen. Returning from the missions on which Kublai sent him, the ingenious foreigner improvised pantomimes that the sovereign had to interpret: one city was depicted by the leap of a fish escaping the cormorant's beak to fall into a net; another city by a naked man running through fire unscorched; a third by a skull, its teeth green with mold, clenching a round, white pearl. The Great Khan deciphered the signs, but the connection between them and the places visited remained uncertain; he never knew whether Marco wished to enact an adventure that had befallen him on his journey, an exploit of the city's founder, the prophecy of an astrologer, a rebus or a charade to indicate a name. But, obscure or obvious as it might be, everything Marco displayed had the power of emblems, which, once seen, cannot be forgotten or confused. In the Khan's mind the empire was reflected in a desert of labile and interchangeable data, like grains of sand, from which there appeared, for each city and province, the figures evoked by the Venetian's logogriphs.
Some exquisite dream-logic:
  ""With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.""
And a koan from Polo:
  Everything I see and do assumes meaning in a mental space where the same calm reigns as here, the same penumbra, the same silence streaked by the rustling of leaves. At the moment when I concentrate and reflect, I find myself again, always, in this garden, at this hour of the evening, in your august presence, though I continue, without a moment's pause, moving up a river green with crocodiles or counting the barrels of salted fish being lowered into the hold.
But I also found it boring, sometimes, and frustrating, and insubstantial and surprisingly unmemorable. ""There is no language without deceit"" — and ""Falsehood is never in words; it is in things."" Perhaps this is why these cities feel so slippery. They seem so alike in their shared language, echoing beauty in triplicate, looking forward into the past at false mirror images. As much as I appreciate Calvino's perceptive descriptions, his onion-peeling wordplay, they hold me at bay. Would I have connected with the book more deeply if I had read it ten years ago? Will Dictionary of the Khazars feel flat if I return to it now? Could it possibly be the same book? So much has happened since I read it.
  ""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents. Your atlas preserves the differences intact: that assortment of qualities which are like the letters in a name.""
Speaking of which, why give all the cities feminine names? Why bring gender into it? And why, as a reader, do I become so much more sensitive to the transience of a love affair with a place when the city lights turn into eyes, the forgotten city into a woman? From the start I felt uncertain, uneasy about this decision, and the ending offers no explanation or closure.
  ""Why do you linger over inessential melancholies?""
Why? Because you ask (or consider asking, or I imagine you asking) questions like this. Because they matter. Because, for some of us, they are essential.",2013-04-13 17:12:14,3,en,2013-04-13 17:12:14,4,2013,0.00146,0.00011,0.00021,0.00013,0.0002,0.00017,1223
Haris Vuk,"Low effort, bullet point takeaways below:Mind bending prose poetry that riffs on various grand themes of humanity through the lens of cities. I'm not usually a fan of overly ornate (to use a word from the book - ""rococo"") language, but it suits this prose well as a way of distinguishing place and invoking the sense of wonder one gets when visiting new places. This books is a sort of blank canvas one can paint many interpretive pictures from (this is alluded to in the book itself in a meta wink at the reader IMO). The core themes I took away from this were:-the duality of man and the resulting inextricably complicated nature of existence (""shades of gray""); there is no such thing as absolute justice or injustice, happiness or unhappiness, clean or dirty, rational or romantic. All of these elements are tightly bound together in any given moment and a pendulum swings from one to the other through time, the tempo depending on the perspective (which is also never perfect and ever changing - one of the key parts of being a human)-the ephemeral nature of all things // the insignificance of certain things which we hold of high importance // the inherent entropy of the universe and mankind and its ability to subsume all around it-given all this, the need to take a step back and breath, to appreciate beauty, wonder and happiness and embrace those parts of ourselves-part of this formula is broadening the mind's eye and understanding of self through the procurement of new perspectives. Becoming aware of the ""inferno"" of modern living-I enjoyed the riffs on suburbia and the low effort sameness that is intoxicatingly easy and comfortable to slip into for people. This, along with other things (alluded to above - entropy, greed, false idols, etc.), defines the ""inferno"" of living today. The ending of the book, after many cycles of depictions of the need for broader perspective, calls on the reader to acknowledge that awareness of the ""inferno"" is a choice and to attempt to be always be aware of this. ""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""",2021-01-09 23:54:02,4,en,2021-01-09 23:54:02,1,2021,0.00145,0.0001,0.00022,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,446
MontVert,"A little too opaque and obscure at times, but full of great observations about travel. Calvino understands what many early modern explorers didn't: that travellers never see the city as the locals do. They see reflections of their home. It's the anti-Orientalism.Reminds me of Clough: ""'Tis but to prove limitation, and measure a cord, that we travel... Tis but to change idle fancies for memories wilfully falser; 'Tis but to go and have been."" Also reminds me of Kahneman's remembering self vs. experiencing self. Plus ""see it for the first time"" Eliot quote. Good Quotes:- ""in the lives of emperors, there is ... the melancholy and relief of knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding [the conquered territories]""- ""its green borders repeat the dark outline of the buried lake; an invisible landscape conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight is driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock...""- ""the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood ..the familiar places of his youth, and the surroundings of home, and a little square of Venice where he gambolled as a child"".- ""Arriving at each new city, the traveller finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places"".- ""Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveller recognizes the little that is his, discovering much has not had and will never have"".- “Men of various nations had a dream. They saw a woman running at night through an unknown city…”- “If you go by whistling, your nose a-tilt behind the whistle, you will know it from below: window sills flapping curatins, fountains. If you walk along hanging your head, your nails dug into the palms of your hands, your gaze will be held on the ground, in the gutters, the manhold covers, the fish scales…” - you can go from happy to sad, but the opposite is harder.- “Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,” Pol said,” Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little”- “Confess what you are smuggling: moods, states of graces, elegies!”- “the form of things can be discerned better at a distance”",2019-04-04 00:05:44,3,en,2019-04-04 00:05:44,4,2019,0.0058,0.00011,0.00036,0.00016,0.00038,0.00024,403
Kate Lee,"I picked this book up in Faulkner House Books, a New Orleans bookstore in the most picturesque alley with the best vibes. I knew I had to get a book there and I chose Invisible Cities because I'd heard great things about it and the cover was so unique (almost like a textured cover?). I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it, because it's a stunning book that almost defies classification: a collection of vignettes, a bunch of traveling tales, and just pockets of imagination in one? The Ups: The whole book sets its premise on Marco Polo describing his travels and the places he's been to Kublai Khan, who wants to know everything he can about his massive empire. There are little snippets of their conversations at the beginning and end of each section, but most of the book itself consists of small, maybe one-page descriptions of different cities. None of them are explicitly familiar or real, but all explore a different aspect of the crazy, marvelous phenomenon of a city, a civilization living together.I particularly enjoyed that there were a few subtle but very clear themes that Calvino named. Before each description of a city, he would group it under a heading, such as ""Cities &amp; Memory,"" ""Cities &amp; Signs,"" ""Thin Cities,"" ""Trading Cities,"" etc. It was such a great way of almost guiding the reader through what else might be an overwhelming anthology. They acted as almost like little reminders of what to think about for each city. But more than anything, the descriptions of the cities themselves are what make this book incredible. It's amazing to see how Calvino could create such complexity by just simple language and imagined places; we know the cities that extend into the ground or hang from skies can't be real, but there's something about the physical realities of these cities that illuminates the hidden social realities of our real ones. Each one is so short that the whole book feels very readable as each city kind of passes and blurs; but what's fascinating is this blurring creates the overall effect of all the cities kind of becoming one. Personally, I hadn't ever really thought of or questioned the existence of cities before reading this. It seems so natural, just the way people congregate. But it was only after reading about the constantly changing and hoping and growing cities of Calvino that I realized the city is a very chaotic, beautiful thing. They're almost like external projections of human nature and desire itself, and Calvino encapsulates that so masterfully. The Downs: Maybe that it felt so short? I feel like I could have read these descriptions forever...And just for fun- so much incredible art has been inspired by these cities! A collection can be found here.

Kevin Mora,"Every chapter of the book was written by a different Calvino; his sad, angry, romantic, curious, mysterious, and hesitated moments are the mold of this humongously beautiful agglomerate of personalities and emotions. Sometimes our imagination ends up in a dystopia, or in a chimeric utopia whom existence ends in the voyage of the 'thinking.' Just a little flavor of reason is enough to destroy the Atlas of our dreams. Let me present to you the most beautiful quotes –element whose meaning is proportional to the quality of any skull's experience:""The hell of the living is not something that will be; there is one, it is the one that exists already here, the hell that we inhabit every day, that we form being together. There are two ways of not suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the hell and become part of it to the point of never seeing it again. The second is dangerous and requires continuous attention and learning: seek and know how to recognize who and what, in the midst of hell, is not hell, and make it last; give it space...""""There is no point in dividing cities in these two species, but in two others: those that through the years and mutations continue to shape desires and those in which desires either manage to erase the city, or are erased by it.""""Of the number of cities imaginable we must exclude those in which they are added elements without a thread connecting them, without an internal rule, a perspective, a speech. It happens with cities as with dreams: everything imaginable can to be dreamed but even the most unexpected dream is a riddle that hides a wish, or its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are built of desires and fears, although the thread of his speech is secret, his absurd rules, their deceptive perspectives, and everything hides another.""""Or else the cloud stopped just out of the lips, dense and slow, and referred to another vision: exhalations that stagnate on the roofs of metropolis, the opaque smoke that does not disperse, the layer of miasma that weighs on the bituminous streets.

Linh Sa Arnold,"The first of (hopefully many lol) efforts of actually reflecting back on reading! Please bare with me. To read Invisible Cities during a pandemic is a somewhat surreal and melancholy experience. As someone who often spends their time daydreaming of, and planning, their next trip, Cities was a delight and a luxury of being able to feel the romanticism associated with setting foot in a new environment (be that city, country, street, etc...), something bittersweet as who knows when any of us will be able to feel that again? Having spent some time in Venice while living in Milan, I always delight in reading about how the city (and more generally, Italy) is viewed through the lens of a stranger, whether that's through fiction, biographies, or even social media. While living in Italy, I was working through Henry James' Italian Hours, a book of essays on the Italian cities that James visited throughout his life's travels, and was reminded of how much I love travel writing and reading of one's personal experience in space and time. Cities evokes the nostalgia of Hours but is a much easier read -- still working through Hours haha -- that I know I will return to often, especially before/during future travels (whenever that will be...). Reading of these fantastical cities through the experiences of both the traveller and story teller (Marco Polo), and the listener (Kublai Khan), one feels simultaneously both the nostalgia of reminiscing on past trips through Polo, and what almost feels like Khan's envy, though mostly curiosity, as he listens to Polo's tales and tries to understand or ""poke holes in"" his travel tales (something that feels especially relevant given that today's narrative of this story would almost be that of the endless stream of vacation and travel content we consume via Instagram, no? Are we not endlessly obsessed with the reality and intention behind the media we consume?). Transcending time and dancing on the lines of reality and fantasy, Cities was a meditative experience that makes me long for setting foot in either a new city/culture or one that has a stimulus or pace different to that of where I live now.",2020-10-05 00:41:11,4,en,2020-10-05 00:41:11,10,2020,0.00072,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00017,0.00014,362
James Varney,"More a collection of modernist riddles than a novel in the conventional sense. ""Invisible Cities"" has its charms - its imagery is outstanding, and it's a cool concept. Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are engaged in a kind of dreamy, mystical conversation. Marco describes multiple cities he has supposedly visited during his continent-spanning travels. It's unclear if the conversation is spoken, if it is only a chess game, or even sometimes if it is understood by the participants. Regardless, Calvino packs ""Invisible Cities"" with all the modern leftist notions, and especially the importance leftist French intellectuals put on ""language"" in the latter decades of the 20th century. There's a lot here about ""signs"" and ""signified"" etc. Everything is copied, mirrored, doubled, reversed, repeated, rearranged, etc. Some of this is fun: ""I followed the alphabetic order of vanished alphabets,"" Marco Polo says of a library. Or, ""signs form a language but not the one you think you know."" Ah, ""signs"" again. Or, ""...especially their pronunciation of periods and commas...""But in truth this line of thinking has undermined and perverted language to the point we are at today, where words do not mean what they once did, or are in fact deployed as the opposite of their definition and common sense. This leftist critique of language has destroyed language as a means of communication. Now, it's a cloak.""Invisible Cities"" is broken into categories like ""Hidden Cities,"" ""Cities and the Sky,"" Cities and Eyes,"" Trading Cities"" and - of *course* - ""Cities and Signs."" The chapters are super short, Borges-like.The descriptions of the cities, many of which have winding staircases and balconies, with canals and lagoons and verandas and spires - much of it is exotic and splendid. And much of it is fun. But, in the end, it's just a game. Take this semi colon clogged bit on a city Marco Polo calls ""Irene"":""For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have only spoken of Irene.""",2023-01-24 00:40:32,3,en,2023-01-24 00:40:32,1,2023,0.00132,0.0001,0.0002,0.00011,0.00019,0.00017,380
Mihai,"What a conflicting book this was. Before proceeding with my final considerations I have to say that reading the short stories Italo Calvino pictured was the closest I ever got to reading poetry without reading actual poetry.We are in the 14-th century and Marco Polo is at the court of Kublai Khan, the famous Mongol ruler. The Venetian traveler is seducing the khan with stories from places far away that push his imagination to the limit.Some of these imagined cities are an absolute joy to picture and navigate with the power of the mind. Despina comes to my mind, the city which could only be reached be ship or by camel, showing a different face to the traveler or Fedora the grey metropolis with a metal building in its center that has a crystal globe in every room and when looking in each of these crystals one could see the forms the city could have taken if, for one reason or another, it had not become the city the travelers see today. Another favourite of mine was Zobeide. A city founded by men which shared a dream chasing a naked woman running at night through an unknown city. Each of them lost her in the chase but after the dream they set out in search of that city. They never found it but they found one other and they decided to build a city like the one in their dream. They laid the streets, each following his pursuit but at the spot where they lost the woman's trail they arranged walls differently from the dream so that she would be unable to escape again. Or the city of Ersilia where the inhabitants stretch strings from the corner of the houses to mark the relationships between themselves. When the strings become too numerous that they can no longer pass among them, they leave and the houses are dismantled and only the strings and their supports remain. However besides these few gems I found the other cities tedious and extremely pretentious to read. One gets the feeling that this little book is too long and the author insists on a recipe that worked 3 or 4 times but cannot work with all 55 cities. The moments of joy and originality were shadowed by the repetition and the rest of the cities which were not so captivating in the end.",2017-08-16 04:54:30,3,en,2017-08-16 04:54:30,8,2017,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,397
Giacomo,"This was a weird, beautiful book. I’ve read other works by Italo Calvino before and some of them are among my favourites, so it was with a little apprehension that I finally started to read “Invisible cities” after being curious about it for so long. Thankfully I wasn’t disappointed.The elderly and melancholy Kublai, Grand Khan of the Mongols, meets every day with one or the other of his many envoys, who come back from every corner of his huge empire with punctilious reports about war and trade and taxes. But the one he truly looks forward to talk to is the Venetian trader and explorer Marco Polo, who contrarily to the others tells wondrous tales of fantastic cities that nobody else seems to know about. These short descriptions of cities, that could easily be called poems in prose, make up the bulk of the book, divided into nine chapters opened and closed by brief, almost philosophical dialogues between Kublai and Marco that set the tone for the intervening pages. Each tale then belongs to a thematic series, that frames how we think of it and connects it to the others.Does the Khan truly believe everything he hears? Probably not, as it’s suggested in many of his conversations with Marco, but he, and we readers with him, can glimpse that there’s something in these descriptions of marvellous cities that goes beyond mere truth and hints to deeper meanings.When I started reading the book I confess that for a while I didn’t know what to make of it, until it dawned on me that this is not a book to power through, always looking forward to what’s going to happen next, but a book to savour slowly. That way Adelma, peopled by dead friends, relatives and acquaintances, Ersilia, where social connections have physical existence and are left behind when the city moves, Raissa, that hides fleeting threads of happiness of whom its own unhappy inhabitants are unaware, Leandra, Berenice, Melania, Andria, Clarice, Olinda, and so many others, can truly come to life like they did for Kublai Khan and tell us something about ourselves and the world. This is a book that will stay with me and I can easily see myself going back to revisit these cities from time to time.",2020-02-23 18:22:30,5,en,2020-02-23 18:22:30,2,2020,0.00096,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,380
Hamza Zia,"""Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.""⁣⁣My favorite kind of books are the ones I go into not expecting to be blown away, yet by the end I am nothing but at a loss for words to articulate the incredible literary joyride they take me through. 'Invisible Cities' is the latest book to do that for me.⁣⁣We enter the novel and see the meeting between fabled European traveler Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, the emperor of China, whose empire extends beyond the farthest reaches of the horizon. Both men seem to take an interest towards one another and the great Khan asks the Venetian traveler to recount some of the cities he has seen on his legendary conquests.⁣⁣This begins 'Invisible Cities' as Marco Polo begins to describe the most magical of cities comprehensible to the imagination. These cities are so beautiful and dreamlike, they seemingly cannot exist in the real world. Yet the Khan listens as Marco Polo describes exotic cities with magnificent gates made of crystals, cities with spiral domes resembling seashells, cities that travelers only find when they reach old age, cities where everyone looks like someone you once knew in life who died, cities made on top of lakes in a way that their reflection creates their mirror image on the surface of the water, cities that resemble the very last city you left, cities that follow constellations and orbits of stars, etc. There are almost a hundred of these on display here. ⁣⁣Reading about these cities, you're unsure if Marco Polo is imagining them, or if he's finding different ways to talk about only one, his beloved Venice. ⁣⁣Yet in each description of a city, we discover insights on the human experience. If cities are made by the hands of us humans, then they in essence reflect our joys, sorrows, triumphs, collective achievements and humiliations in their forms. ⁣⁣This is a read that you can finish in 2 or 3 sittings.

Tom,"So basically 1001 Arabian Nights, Italian style - though specifically tales of imagined cities. In that regard it reminded me a bit more of Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams - though more cryptic. And by that I mean that, while Lightman's imagined cities straightforwardly tell stories of people dealing with time that behaves differently than we know it, Calvino's (or should I say Marco Polo's) imagined cities are all allegorical descriptions of the absurdities of human nature, behavior, and, particularly, society. Very well. Plenty of deeper meaning to be discovered there and normally that would appeal to me. But a funny thing happened in the telling. Being that the premise of this book is that of a young Marco Polo regaling Kublai Khan with tales of the many cities encountered in his travels through the vast Tartar empire, one would expect the vignettes to be consistent with Polo's era: the late 13th century. How then to account for the passing references to things like radar antennae, steamships, motorcyclists, washing machines, and airports? Pretty sure none of those were to be found way back then. At first I'd thought maybe something had gone awry with the translation from Calvino's original Italian to the English edition I was reading. But then of course I realized this was a device to let the reader know that the noted human absurdities are not 700+ year old relics. They include us modern types as well. Hmm, interesting. But for me, it was also utterly deflating. The beautifully drawn picture of the imperial audience in the great Khan's private garden...gone. I'd not thought myself such a literalist, but there you are. My reading experience: diminished. So while I appreciate the lovely imagery, the gracefully flowing language, and the great opportunity for philosophical contemplation, Invisible Cities ultimately didn't work too well for me.",2020-08-06 22:06:19,3,en,2020-08-06 22:06:19,8,2020,0.00101,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,305
Jeff,"It definitely feels like a cop-out to give INVISIBLE CITIES three stars and not something more strongly felt. Calvino's imagined conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan is certainly masterful at... something. Polo spends the book describing imaginary cities to Khan from Khan's own empire; cities that are all named for women; cities with a remarkably disparate range of attributes including being never-ending suburbs, mirror towns, towns of monsters, towns suspended from great heights on spiderwebs; cities that it's unclear if Polo has actually travelled to; cities that it's unclear of Khan even understands about; etc.Fifty-five prose poems, one per city, comprise the novel's body, plus a handful of interstitial conversations between Khan and Polo, so it's a very brief read. These poems might be meditations on various concepts (they are subgrouped by memory, desire, etc.), but those meditations are very opaque. Calvino's favorite technique -- employing a litany of details to cascade over you -- is effective in bringing each town to light in a sort of vague, dreamlike way. Nothing is terribly identifying, even if many things are highly specific.This book is not about anything -- there is no plot. Reader be warned. You're signing up for (and, to be fair, it's Calvino and you should've known) some ART. Unsuspecting readers might be furious with the indecipherability of it all; pretentious readers might lord an affection for it over others with an air of ""you just don't get it"" (me, probably twenty years ago); my more middle ground take is this: I'm all for art and concept, but I like to be able to understand a bit more of the message behind the art, and here, I felt only the most passing breeze of the themes. Because I wasn't lapping up high concept, I was simultaneously awaiting some epiphany that would bring the whole story into focus or at least relief. There's a bit of the abstract art to this: you look at a canvas of paint splatters and geometric shapes and a random figure and you think, ""Well, this is very COOL, and the artist probably has something very interesting to SAY, but I'm just not smart enough to know what it is.""

chip,"""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven"". As Milton's Lucifer finds that the state of his confinement is not limited to a sedentary region but has become intrinsic to his being as an immutable nature, Calvino's Marco Polo travels constantly in search of some elusive answer coming to the final realization that the only 'place' in which we truly learn is within ourselves, in contemplation of our memories. Arriving at each destination, Marco is never satisfied, never settled, but he knows that he never will be. In every stranger he finds a life he might have shared, had he at any time decided this was enough, and stopped. He describes skeletal cities of pipes devoid of walls, floors, or ceilings, abandoned ruins with only a web of threads tied between lost relationships whose weavers have abandoned them, and cities occupied by the living, the dead, and those who have not yet been born, each waiting to make the journey to the next. But no matter how different these places may appear, their inhabitants are always the same. The merchants who come from cities of their own to exchange memories, the brotherhood of living and dead emissaries always working to model the one from the other, the dreamers who build a city to capture a fantasy and waste their lives waiting for a woman who never existed. Though their purposes may be different, they are each of them a traveler. Like Marco Polo, the traveler sets out with the hope of making a grand discovery, as if his feet will be the first to scrape across a desert, to dangle in a stream, as if being the first would make that land his own. Though the Khan holds the warlord's title, Marco is just as covetous, wanting all the world for his own name, though in fact all we can ever truly own are our selves, our memory, our desire, our signs, our names. And one day the Earth we have claimed will come to reclaim us, and it will own even our cities, which in building we already forfeit. ""Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much that he has not had and will never have.""",2023-02-11 03:44:45,4,en,2023-02-11 03:44:45,2,2023,0.00177,0.00011,0.00023,0.00013,0.00021,0.00018,387
Hallie,"This book is a hard one, because you can't just sit down and read it like a novel. It's basically a series of one/two page snippets, each about a supposed ""city"" that Marco Polo has visited and is describing to Kublai Khan. At intervals, there are sections of conversation between the two, where they ponder the notion of what a city is, how cities can be known, the need for the Khan to know what's going on in his empire, the nature of existence/reality, etc. The good is obviously the prose; some of the cities are meh, but for the most part they're quite evocative. There's a city with no walls, floors, or ceilings, only plumbing and sinks and showers and pools - populated by naiads playing in the water. There's a city where every few years when the people get sick of their lives, they all switch places and start over with a new job, family, and life. There's an interesting passage where Kublai points out that through all these cities, Marco Polo has never described Venice for him; and Marco Polo counters that every city he has described is in part Venice and also no city is Venice, because Venice is the city he keeps in his heart and measures all others by. The bad is, well; you can't sit down and read the book. I started it on a flight to a conference almost a year ago, and if you read too much of it at once they all just blur together and get *extremely* boring and frustrating. It has to be read in little snippets, one or two cities at a time, which is tedious. Also, most of the cities can be summed up in a sentence (as the ones above); they're really just concepts, drawn out in florid poetic prose to the length of a couple pages. I'm not a litfic reader - I read for stories - so lot of the hyper-conceptual philosophizing is boring when there's no plot involved. By chance, I also read this shortly after reading ""Those Who Walk Away From Omelas"" for the first time, and I gotta say: when it comes to describing a fascinating invented city with deep philosophical implications? Butler does it well *and* makes it interesting.",2019-04-29 01:33:13,3,en,2019-04-29 01:33:13,4,2019,0.00151,0.00011,0.00024,0.00011,0.00021,0.00016,380
Noah Marcus,"Marco Polo and Kublai Khan getting high and discussing the same real &amp; imaginary city from many, many different angles is exactly the content and reprieve I needed while getting through the densest book I have ever read, Capital in the 21st Century. Italo's vision is both deceptively clear and monotonously abstract. This book gave my brain whiplash, having to context switch into an entire new logical framework every. single. page. While it may only be 164 pages, each page of this book contains more wisdom and insight into society and the ways in which we construct our historical narratives than entire novels I have read. Somehow, even taking over a month to slowly work my way through this short novel, I know at least 50% (at a minimum), has been lost of me. An idea that Italo comments on in the book itself:“I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”Every time I picked up the book to finish it, I would end up reading 2 pages and have to put this book down because it would entirely deconstruct a held belief I didn't even know I had. There was a lot to unpack. I wanted to give this book 4 stars while reading certain parts. While it is incredibly ambitious, the style can be repetitive and the ""whiplash"" is not the most pleasant reading experience. But how can you not give it up for this incredible feat, a book that is literally the exploding brain meme in 164 pages? Such a good book, and I will be happy to return to it and think about these grand ideas the rest of my life.",2019-12-16 23:06:16,5,en,2019-12-16 23:06:16,12,2019,0.00083,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,370
Alejandro Brioso,"A tale full of patterns, of symbols, of symmetries. Invisible Cities is a literary object which can be played with, theorized about, scrutinized, and offers a vast amount of possibilities through the marvel of combinatorics, just like a go or chess board can.Marco Polo's accounts of the cities he visits during his travels make up a collection of prose poems whose frame story consists, in a certain way, of prose poems as well. These not only are beautiful per se, but gain in complexity through their position in a whole, since the fifty-five cities are divided in eleven categories, which spread throughout the nine sections of the book in a cascade-pattern. Thus, each of the seven middle sections contains the descriptions of five cities, whereas the first and the ninth section contain ten of these each, so that cities from at least five different categories appear in every section. Moreover, each section starts and ends with a dialogue between Polo and Kublai Khan that allows it to stand out on its own.Reading this book, I happily noticed that the names of the categories can be found frequently in the text. I tried to write down where each of them appears. If I counted right, the word eye —or its plural eyes—, for instance, appears in the descriptions of sixteen different cities and in at least five dialogues between Kublai Khan and Polo. I am not sure if I have found a pattern yet, but I do not believe that the appearances of these words are random at all. I wonder...Between each idea and each point of the itinerary an affinity or a contrast can be established, serving as an immediate aid to memory. So the world's most learned men are those who have memorized Zora.The structure of Invisible Cities is quite alluring and calls for a second reading of the book, following not the order of the sections, but that of the categories. Or just reading one category at a time, for example by following the ""Cities &amp; Memory"" line. I haven't tried any of this, but look forward to doing so in the future.",2022-10-16 23:55:16,5,en,2022-10-16 23:55:16,10,2022,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,355
Jakob,"This book defies description, I have not read anything similar to it. It doesn't have a narrative, though it is loosely based on imagined encounters between marco polo and kublai khan, where the former tells the latter of the cities he has visited in the khan's vast kingdom. But these are not really descriptions of cities, not real ones at least. The tales grow taller and the story swerves and soon takes a surrealist turn. Before long this was more a flight into dreamlands, where things were never as they seemed an what was deemed normal was a strange behaviour or other. This quote from the book might as well be Calvino describing his own finished work:“Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” It has no story arch and no real ending. Chapters are grouped into cities of different forms. It was a disorienting and feverish read. I listened to this one on audio as much as i read it, which might have contributed to this interpretation. Some of the chapters are masterful poetic reveries, while some feel more like repetitions of earlier ones. Books can take you to strange places and I seldom felt more like a stranger than when reading of these impossible places.I also got a new one among my favorite quotes:“The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”",2018-10-31 17:38:49,4,en,2018-10-31 17:38:49,10,2018,0.00088,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,335
Sam Cristol,"The premise of this short novel is that Marco Polo (yes, that Marco Polo) is describing the cities he has seen on his adventures to Kublai Khan. The book jumps from city to city, with short interludes describing Marco Polo and Kublai Khan interacting. Although supposedly describing cities, many bear human (and often feminine) names, and the descriptions range from the fantastical to the practical. Often cities are used as analogies to human nature, or describe sociological phenomena. Calvino does an excellent job remarking on time, change, growth, death, hopes, and dreams through the walls that he constructs with his words.I'd often find myself reading and re-reading a short description of a city. One of my all-time favorites for sure is the city of Maurilia in ""Cities &amp; Memory 5"". My favorite quote (that I highlighted and keep reading over and over):""It is pointless to ask whether the new ones are better or worse than the old, since there is no connection between them, just as the old post cards do not depict Maurilia as it was, but a different city which, by chance, was called Maurilia, like this one."" - pg 31. It might just be the stress of the changed world we are now stepping into, but the passage has been almost therapeutic: I read it and remind myself that the world is different now than it was, and that the old was still in itself different than it once was at a time before then. I also very much enjoyed the passage about the city of Berenice ""Hidden Cities 5"". The last sentence stuck with me: ""all the future Berenices are already present in this instant, wrapped one within the other, confined, crammed, inextricable."" I love this thought about future selves &amp; the changing of people. It is comforting to think how my future selves are wrapped within my current. How everything that happens comes from within, and builds upon the current self.",2021-07-29 03:30:04,5,en,2021-07-29 03:30:04,7,2021,0.00068,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,326
Rebecca,"""Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else""A wonderful and beautiful collection of imagined cities - hidden cities, continuous cities, cities built or crushed by desire, thin cities, dead cities. These visions of splendor and humanity are told by the philosophical Marco Polo to Kublai Khan as a vast description of the great Khan's empire. the descriptions of cities focus not so much on the outward aspect of these places, but more in the inner lives of the streets, buildings, and people - the lore, the legends, the desires and perceptions and how it feels to be there. The story is in the details, as mirrored by Marco's reading of the history of the wood of a black square on a chessboard. There is a city ""where memory is traded at every solstice and at every equinox,"" an unfinished city standing only as a working network of pipes, a city rebuilt from shared dreams, a mirrored city, a city waiting to be crushed by its growing piles of excess waste - the cities hold meaning and answers to questions posed, verbally or telepathically, by Kublai Khan as he converses with the poetic traveler.In telling the story of the cities, Marco Polo also tells the story of what it means to be a traveler, to find oneself in so many places, to approach on camel-back or by ship, to see a place only from the outside, to find similarities and differences among them all: ""the more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there"" and to find similarities and differences among the traveler's many selves:""the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places""Filled with surreal imagery, intriguing ideas, and captivating concepts, this is a delight to read.",2021-08-26 06:31:37,4,en,2021-08-26 06:31:37,8,2021,0.00119,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00017,334
Katie,"Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino is hard book to place. Each section of this book incites endless pondering regarding the meaning of place. Each chapter will leave the reader more thoroughly convinced that they do not know place. As in, place is nothing and everything and seems indefinable because it can be anything to anyone. A unique definition as to what place can be is evident in each chapter, so each chapter could easily show the significance of this novel. After reading this novel, one can no longer think of place as simply a place, but more so as a signifier for something. Place is only what it presents itself as because that is literally all we can see and understand. Within the work, Calvino makes place this abstract and truly unattainable thing. The book states, “However the city may really be, beneath this thick coating of signs, whatever it may contain or conceal, you leave Tamara without having discovered it.” That is how the narrator and author want readers to image place. Place is so diverse that even experiencing it, walking through the streets, one doesn’t really know it. Invisible Cities really sends the idea of what place can be into a whole new and infinite direction. Throughout the work, Calvino takes the reader through a journey of the fictitious empire Kublai Khan aims to conquer through his acquired storyteller, Marco Polo. Each city added to the ruler’s empire is fantastical yet revealing core truths of place if one can look past the eccentricities. This book is one that leaves readers inquisitorial and inspired to look at the world anew. Calvino’s masterful world building and clever fictionalized historical narrators combine to create a story like no other. It can be read chronologically and randomly. The narrative will still provide the reader with a pleasurable and understandable experience no matter how it is read. This book is a must-read, not just once but many times over.",2021-11-30 09:31:11,5,en,2021-11-30 09:31:11,11,2021,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,326
Jeruen,"This is a very interesting book, not necessarily because of the narrative and the plot that is presented, but more because of its mathematical precision. See, Italo Calvino is a member of the Oulipo literary group, which is composed of writers that wanted to write literature that satisfy some challenging aspect (e.g. like writing a novel without using the letter E). This book actually has a mathematical order imposed on it, with cities being narrated one after another, like a grid or a matrix.The frame to this story is a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Marco Polo narrates to Kublai Khan the various cities that he has visited, and most of these narrations are more fantastic than realistic. These snippets of the conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo delineates the various different cities that are described in prose poetry.If you're looking for a story, then this book is probably not for you. But this book delivers something else. It pushes the boundary of what a novel could look like. It also adds a very precise metric structure to the narrative, which reminds me more of musical compositions than literature. This is a literary work that I thought needed much forward thinking and conception because it seems that Calvino would have finalised the skeletal structure of the novel before actually writing the prose. I must say I admire the style, and recommend it to anyone that is a fan of his more known book. If you have read 
  <em>If on a Winter's Night a Traveller</em>

Cockle,"A review of Invisible citiesI’m gong to take one example of a city, from a book of 55 examples, this one is about a city named Aglaura in the section titled “Cities and Names 1” P59 of the English translation Vintage 1997How well do you feel you have been informed about Aglaura?What do you feel you have been told?I am immediately drawn to the conclusion that we mythologise our own City, and for that matter our own region, our own nation. These myths, call them stories, may be set in song, set in prose, in the case of Aglaura they are set in proverbsItalo Calvino describes these proverbs as repeated by the inhabitants or as behaviour repeated in the rules observed by the locals in their ‘punctiliousness’. That over time these proverbs have little to do with the everyday facts that one sees on the ground on any given afternoon. And a disconnect develops between what is said and what is.“Aglaura imprisons your words and obliges you to repeat rather than say”For me, Calvino is saying ‘watch out’. You too may get boxed in with your mythology, your cliched sayings, your proverbs about yourself and your city. Stories that once may even have been true but have been repeated over and over, but now the words may not fit the new reality, the Aglaura we experience on the ground. He ends by saying that perhaps the real city is lost when we don’t have a new set of words created to describe it. We are lost in the old proverbs, the old songs the old poems and stories that perhaps have now become detached from the Aglaura of today. Aglaura is a fiction and we are invited to imagine a city like Aglaura that we know ourselves, perhaps one in which we live.This is the power of Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities. A city is only about the people who live there, visit there, return there; perhaps even to come home.",2021-11-19 15:52:44,5,en,2021-11-19 15:52:44,11,2021,0.00345,9e-05,0.00025,0.00013,0.00028,0.0002,330

Fantasy, Historical Fiction, Paranormal, Psychology, Travel What was your favorite part in the book? There were so many fantastical cities that it's hard to pick which one is my favorite.

Anyone who likes artistic prose and fantastical places.What is your general opinion/ rating of this book? What did I just read. Ignorantly, I picked up this book thinking this had something to do with city planning or architecture. Oh boy was I wrong. At first I was confused at why this book had such great ratings. The way this book is written reminds me a bit like Shakespeare. It's difficult to read at first, but if you take your time and really chew on the sentences it makes the whole experience much more enjoyable. The descriptions of these fictional cities was very imaginative. Although, a couple of the cities referenced modern day amenities like airplanes. Which confused me because the story seemed to be the retelling of Marco polo's travels to Kublai Khan. So some of the cities were out of the time period where I thought the story was set -- which was a little confusing.

Edwin Blair,"This quote selection is reason enough.

Perhaps while we speak, it is rising, scattered, within the confines of your empire; you can hunt for it, but only in the way I have said.”Already the Great Khan was leafing through his atlas, over the maps of the cities that menace in nightmares and maledictions: Enoch, Babylon, Yahooland, Butua, Brave New World.He said: “It is all useless, if the last landing place can only be the infernal city, and it is there that, in ever-narrowing circles, the current is drawing us.”And Polo said: “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.

Zachary Littrell,"I dunno if it's a sign of idle boredom -- or a tremendous vote of confidence -- for Calvino's Invisible Cities that my mind kept wandering off the whole time while reading this, taking a little stroll into its own invisible cities.When Kublai Khan cracks open his atlas, you realize it's a book stepping on science fiction's toes. A lot of Marco Polo's cities couldn't possibly exist (certainly not in Kublai Khan's fading empire), but they also do. I've never visited Eusapia, the city with an identical twin city underground where the dead live, and I reckon I never will. But I might never visit Paris either. Why is Paris more real than Eusapia? That's what nags the Great Khan's brain.But there is also kind of a nagging ""...so what?"" feeling at the end of the book. It's mostly a thought experiment gone wild and no answers. I've honestly already forgotten most of the cities. On the other hand...a few have stuck around. Like the fairytale of Zobeide, a group of men all dreamed of chasing a beautiful woman, and they built a city where they thought the woman was. They shaped the alleys and the walls and the streets based on where they chased her in their dreams, hoping to finally capture her. Newcomers have the same dream and redesign the city Zobeide to fit their own chase. But anyone who didn't have this dream would look at the bizarre mazes of Zobeide and think it ugly, ""this trap.""The more I re-read it, the more I appreciate the twinkle in Calvino's prose. Even if the book has no point, it is intimately and uniquely itself. If nothing else, I like the chutzpah of an author taking the real Marco Polo's fantasies, and full-on rocketing them into the stratosphere.",2018-09-12 07:21:45,3,en,2018-09-12 07:21:45,9,2018,0.00331,0.00011,0.00033,0.00014,0.0003,0.00021,299
A.M.,"This book is like reading a dream.My dreams are often of houses. Calvino dreams of cities. The Dream dictionary says a house is your sense of self while a dream of a city is an attempt to deal with a complex life situation. That makes sense.For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.It’s a beautiful book with layers of complexity I am certain I have not discovered yet. There must be a clue in the odd numbering and titles but that, too evades me.Signs form a language, but not the one you think you know. p40So many story seeds.Theodora - the city that eradicated all the vermin only to have the mythical pests return; the gargoyles, the griffins and the basilisks.Adelma, where every person you meet has the face of a dead person from your past.Melania, where each inhabitant plays a role in a dialogue and that role changes over time. Ten thousand sceptics, a thousand abandoned king’s sons.Baucis, the city that stands on flamingo legs.Ersilia, where the inhabitants tie string to a house to try and identify the relationship between it and other houses; different colours for different relationships (blood, trade, authority or legacy) until the street becomes impassable and the house has to be abandoned and only the strings remain.I understand why this book is so often on people’s ‘desert island list’; you could read it a hundred times and find something different.5 stars",2019-02-08 05:53:42,5,en,2019-02-08 05:53:42,2,2019,0.00133,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.0002,0.00016,297
Perry,"I really wanted to like this book.In terms of its structure, Invisible Cities is completely unique. A fictional Marco Polo regales Kublai Khan with short descriptions of the innumerable cities he has travelled; these brief reports are occasionally interrupted when we return to the conversation between the two men. Don't get me wrong, all the cities are described immaculately, using esoteric vocabulary that I couldn't quite keep up with to describe each site's distinct architecture, materials, and design. Each vignette wraps up with some pithy aphorisms. I found roughly the first half of the book to be trite and somehow chauvinistic; the oblique turns of phrase concluding each section were sometimes profound, but more often disappointing. That's a hot take, I know! I'm sorry!!The second half of the book is where it gets good, but unfortunately that leaves much less than a hundred pages. The descriptions tend towards the magical, the surreal, and these fantastical cities were actually intriguing to me. Those which were more abstract in concept reminded me of something you might find in a Borges story. Meanwhile, the discussion between Polo and the Khan becomes more heady and philosophical as the lines between dreams and reality become blurred. Perhaps this comes down to preference, but only towards the end did I feel like I was reading proper fables, and that's what I expected out of the book.If you are obsessed with architecture, design, and the history of civilizations, I'm sure you would enjoy this book far more than I did. Still, it's short enough that it's worth reading for practically anyone. At the very least, I don't think I'll think of a city the same way again.",2020-07-01 01:56:10,3,en,2020-07-01 01:56:10,7,2020,0.00073,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,280
Amitava Mazumdar,"Calvino imagines an ongoing conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo during which Polo describes some four dozen metropolises to an appropriately skeptical Khan. The cities that Polo has purported to visit are obviously metaphors used by the author (Calvino) to convey to the reader what he thinks ails modern city life: environmental degradation, lack of communal spirit, excessive emphasis on construction and development, reflections of greed, conformity, conspicuous consumption, etc. But, those metaphors serve a slightly different purpose in Polo’s exchanges with the Khan, Mongol emperor and grandson of Genghis. What Polo literally describes to the incredulous Khan is not the intelligence that any emperor or military leader would typically seek from a traveler like Polo — the state of affairs in his empire, threats from abroad, or foreign sources of culture, wealth, and knowledge; it is apparent to the Khan that what Polo offers is fantasy — cities of the dead, cities with twins or triplets, cities in the sky, cities underground, cities upside down, cities of the future, among others. However, the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that Calvino presents to the reader, Polo presents to the Khan as the soft underbelly of his vast and unintegrated collection of conquests. And the Khan appears to be open to the message. Because “the listener retains only the words he is expecting [and it] is not the voice that commands the story, but the ear,” it is a sign of hope that the Khan listened to Polo’s fictional travels with an open mind and “realized that imperial conquest of cities is illusory and underneath lay only bare ground.” Of course, for all the wisdom Calvino imbues the Khan with in the book, we know from the text neither what the fictional Khan did with it nor whether the real Khan shared it. Nor is it apparent that the real world had heeded the warnings offered to us.",2020-12-29 23:26:06,4,en,2020-12-29 23:26:06,12,2020,0.00084,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,317
Simon Reid,"""Elsewhere is a negative mirror. The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.""I've been nudged in the direction of <em>Invisible Cities</em> numerous times over the years, but it took a friend posting a copy to me before I got around to reading it at long last.In the palace grounds of the Great Kublai Khan, puffing on a long amber pipe, swaying in a hammock, Marco Polo describes to his host many of the most obscure and curious corners of the ruler's vast, unmanageable empire. Most of the places are summed up in less than a page, with just space for a splendid scenic tableau (often a traveller's intoxicated first impression) before theres a sharp, strange turn in the telling. A report might read as a thought experiment, a satire, a gentle parable, a mind-bending paradox — most could be very different things to different people.Certain images and ideas will fix themselves in the memory especially strongly. For me these included Leonia, so fixated on the brand-new that 'the street cleaners are welcomed like angels' and it exists at the centre of an enormous crater of its own expunged rubbish — a pristine city hemmed in by a chain of compressed garbage-mountains that grow by the day. Then there's Thekla, perpetually under construction out of fear of ruin. Eusapia, with its enormous subterranean necropolis, a somewhat idealised version of the living city above, curated by a mysterious group of hooded brothers, is one of the creepiest vignettes.Each far-flung metropolis is differently striking, and Calvino never lets Marco Polo linger too long on one and risk breaking the spell. The concentrated imagination poured into each page is inspiring.",2021-04-02 01:59:29,4,en,2021-04-02 01:59:29,4,2021,0.00083,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,287
José,"Invisible Cities reminds me a little of the Decameron with its framing device and bite-sized individual stories which stand apart from each other, yet at the same time also follow a similar premise. The premise is this: what does the life of a people’s say about them? What can be gleaned from what is said about them, from what is known? Fom what is not? What is left once they are gone of their petty troubles, or of the grand malaise which embitters dreams and makes life a kind of living hell, but which also serves to accentuate dreams and gives them their sweetness, and which allows people to cherish others?In a page or two at most, more is evoked in the empty spaces of what is not said of the inhabitants of each of these cities, of the surreal and mystical elements with which they live and die, and which in their absence, defines them; all this to suggest the reflections of the surreal and mystical which, chillingly, already exist in the life of the readerMaybe it is because I just read The Aleph, but Invisible Cities also reminds me of the non-existent books on the occult Borges uses as introductory devices to set up the plot of his short stories. I can already picture a story of an academic of some kind, who becomes consumed trying to find the ancient ruins to one of the invisible cities, keeping a log of his expeditions through his long tortured life. In the end he becomes a frail man at death’s door, and after having scoured the ends of the earth, and fearing he had wasted his life, he realizes nothing is left for him to find. In the end he had become Marco Polo himself, and in his frenzy, his diary had become replete with every city that could ever exist (Or something like that, I don’t know. We can’t all be Borges)",2022-03-19 08:25:32,4,en,2022-03-19 08:25:32,3,2022,0.00114,0.00011,0.0002,0.00012,0.0002,0.00016,323
Adrian ,"I really like Italo Calvino. Though admittedly I never feel like I am able to completely appreciate his writing, having to read it in translation, every book of his I've read so far has had a concept that's connected with me on a level I've only experienced a handful of times before. They're all the sorts of books I'd want to write if I were an author. Even this one which is essentially a compilation of poems, something I wouldn't typically go for, is poetry done the way I would like to do it. Consider that break in a story where the author briefly sets aside the plot and just takes a moment to set a scene, indulge in their prose and create a mood. Imagine they did that for 150 pages and you get Invisible Cities, in which Kublai Khan listens to Marco Polo describe all the places he has visited in his travels. The book is definitely not going to be for everyone, though I think your enjoyment of it will be heavily dependent on your mood in the moment, which is partly why I'm struggling to settle on a rating. Sometimes it felt like exactly what I needed, and I'd feel compelled to sit in a quiet room reading it aloud just so I could fully soak up all the words. Other times my mind would wander off and the only thing that could bring me back to attention was the thought that, with a small burst of focus, I'd be able to quickly get to the last page and add one more book to my reading tally for the year before uni starts again and I lose my free time. I think I'd prefer to just treat this book as something to be pulled off the shelf when the feeling hits, opened at random and absorbed in for a few minutes before being put back in its place. It will make a nice companion whenever I catch myself mindlessly looking out my bedroom window with nothing to do.",2022-07-24 10:20:17,0,en,2022-07-24 10:20:17,7,2022,0.00075,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,342
Somota,"3.8/5 Wonderfully comments on human nature, time and morality without it being preachy or too on the nose. Incredibly beautiful writing and enjoyable story telling. A breath of fresh air from the usual serious or dated tone too often found in classics. Took me a while to get into the book but the further I got the clearer the meanings of each chapter got. It was easier to see what the stories were implying, what the metaphors were referring to. The lessons became clearer, as did the image of Venice as we got to the middle of the book, despite the things that were out of place. I found it interesting how after it became clear that he was describing Venice, the story telling switched to focus on people and the supernatural, completely shifting from the original purpose of describing cities/ venice. Only after the rough half way point did I find myself truly enjoying the book and understanding why it is what it is. So many wonderfully written metaphors, the writing is absolutely beautiful. However, minus points for the very slow, slightly confusing start, as well as the seemingly randomly placed conversations between Marco Polo and the Great Khan. Maybe it’s just me that didn’t get a lot of their convos, but they took me out of the story and felt it unnaturally broke up the flow of the book too often. Some of my absolute favourite chapters/ quotes: Cities and the dead 2 - 85 - Grief and loss (and hints of denial) so wonderfully describes how we carry the grief of our lost ones and try finding them in everyone we meet thereafter. How we personify grief for others. Cities and the dead 3 - 99 - the consequences of living to die or waiting until death to become what we really want. How suddenly there’s a switch from us deciding what there is after death, and how that illusion collapses and we realise our lives are being puppeteered by that which comes after death. Loved loved - “there is no longer any way in knowing who is alive and who is dead”. Continuous cities - so relevant today - the fragile balance that we are at with global wastage, with the newer, “better” materials just being more resistant to decay, the selfish nature of the wasteful western world and how easily it will all tumble and flatten the illusion we’ve created of a clean world and our obsession with the new. And yet once again, Calvino comments on it without sounding preachy. Pg 137 “at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.”",2023-01-12 00:12:05,4,en,2023-01-12 00:12:05,1,2023,0.00109,0.00011,0.0002,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,443
Geoff Wooldridge,"There is no question that Italian writer Italo Calvino is an imaginative, witty and alluring writer. His 'If On a Winter's Night a Traveller..' certainly confirmed that.In 'Invisible Cities', he again lets his imagination and flair for story telling run wild, describing imagined conversations between 13th century Silk Road explorer, Marco Polo, and renowned Mongolian ruler Kublai Khan, in which Polo describes cities of the world which he has, allegedly, visited, but which, in reality, are completely fabricated.At one point, it is even suggested that Polo's descriptions are all based on various elements of the city of Venice, but that seems unlikely. Many of the cities he describes could not possibly exist in reality.The tone of each of these very short yarns (mostly a few paragraphs, less than a single page) is magical and mystical, frequently surrealistic, as Polo describes city layouts and buildings, the people who inhabit them and the philosophical or moral perspectives that identify these places.The writing is clever and lush, including frequent anachronisms - he mentions buses, trams and even airports and flying, not really a feature of 13th century cities! I found these instances really jarring.Despite the cleverness of it all these imagined cities, and the supposed conversations between these two historical luminaries (did they ever really meet in person?), I found the book, on the whole, to be episodic, fragmented, lacking in flow and, ultimately, unsatisfying. I just could not get into it.I couldn't really see the point of the exercise. This is intellectual entertainment perhaps, but not one that made me stand up to applaud and demand more.",2023-02-06 09:57:51,3,en,2023-02-06 09:57:51,2,2023,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,265

As,"Cities are many things and one thing. One among these things is a malleable, reflexive construction that shapes with the projected relationship of desire and fear. Another of these things is that the past, present, and future cities are contained within each past, present, and future, as a relationship may be drawn within them to give each meaning, when they really are one in the same.But, paradoxically, freeingly, or perhaps actually a given, there exists a capacity for mindful stillness, of connection to that which rejects this temporal yet infinite, seeded containment. There exists the capacity to experience that which is simultaneously contained within the city yet which strikes forth light not contained within the city, within the bounds of what viewers may deem temporal containment. Does this paradox describe a truly free and non-contained relationship, a specter of possibility, of authentic light in another? Or does this paradox describe but a contained feature within the city, albeit one that calls forth a notion of freeing beauty? And, if this is but a contained feature, what of the ability for a city to display that which paradoxically it is not?The message I take away from the end is to maintain hope of authentic connection, of the possibility of finding others who have not given up and succumbed to the inferno. These people may be quite different to different people. But cherish those connections you witness. Grow them. Give them space to expand, to fill with non-contained light. And yet, most challengingly, the best way to allow this vigilance and connection is to mindfully let go.",2018-01-08 03:26:00,5,en,2018-01-08 03:26:00,1,2018,0.00102,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,265
Cole Feldman,"Calvino takes poetic and beautiful language, which at times makes no sense at all, and frames it into a narrative with structure that gives the reader something to grab onto. It is easier for us to imagine Polo telling these stories to Kahn, and also to imagine each city neatly categorized into the name which Calvino gives it. It would be much more difficult to read, like any poetry, if Calvino simply described the cities as he does, seemingly for no reason at all.One of Calvino's great strengths is to have a sentence totally out of context still appeal to us deeply by the musicality of its syllables and the emotions of its words like ""lips"" and ""girls.""Finally, I have a theory about the book: There is one city and Calvino has ideas about the characteristics of this one city, and each one of his invisible cities demonstrates one of each of these characteristics. I think similarly about characters in my novels, in the sense that I myself have certain characteristics: logical and Western, meditative and Eastern, in love and irresponsible, successful and failing, and so on. But if I were to write all these characteristics into one character, he/she would be too complex and not easily relatable to the reader. However, if I grant each of these characteristics to its own character all alone, then I am able to clearly define, name, and categorize each character and I can even relate them to one another. It seems to me that Calvino does the same in ""Invisible Cities,"" by taking all the characteristics that make any one place so complex, separating them, and assigning each of them to its own city.",2018-04-01 07:03:58,4,en,2018-04-01 07:03:58,4,2018,0.0007,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,281
James,"The idea behind this book is promising, but it fell fairly short of my hopes. At first it was pleasant enough. I like the style of writing, generally, which is surreal and evocative. Some of the imagery is quite beautiful and some passages thought provoking. But as the book went on, it began to feel repetitive and forced, and soon most of the joy in reading disappeared. The gimmick had worn off.There are some good ideas in the book, but too many come off as hollow attempts to sound profound, either lofty sounding nonsense or commonplace observations dressed up as if they were new. For example, Trude, which has ""suburbs ... no different from the others, with the same little greenish and yellowish houses."" You see, ""the world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end. Only the name of the airport changes.""The dialogues between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are particularly bad in this regard, and often sound like two pseudo-intellectuals attempting philosophy while high on drugs. For example, they have a conversation about whether they, or various workers and commoners, really exist, suggesting nonsensically that their own existence is mutually exclusive with that of the others, ending with Khan saying, ""We have proved that if we were here, we would not be,"" and Polo replying, ""And here, in fact, we are.""What is good in this book would have been much better without these passages, I think. So overall, my judgment is that Invisible Cities is an idea with potential, imperfectly executed in a way that only made me feel that lost potential more acutely. A disappointment that I really wanted to love, but couldn't.",2019-04-12 14:53:22,2,en,2019-04-12 14:53:22,4,2019,0.00082,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,282
Zo ,"Magical and enchanting in mesmerizing fashion while still managing to be interesting on meta-fictional, philosophical, and even socio-reflective grounds. Reading it the parable/allegoric nature of the cities and Khan/Polo's within text meta-commentary on the proceedings felt like it constantly demanded interpretation, but also was playing with and resisting the idea of interpretation at the same time. I'll have to read more to figure out if there are consistent threads/veins of interpretation beyond the playful push-and-pull I experienced. Really interested in learning more about his place in the web of literary influences because it felt similar to people like Borges/Marquez/Sebald/Pamuk/Murakami/others, but I'm not sure precisely where he fits in terms of aping versus creating. If I can tentatively guess at a ""meaning"" it felt like there was ongoing affirmation of the importance of play/fiction and how imagination and distance can allow those forms of contemplation, but a simultaneous emphasis on the importance of attending to the underside of the light/airy/good. Lots of other philosophical fodder in terms of the eternal recurrence, idealism, and other ideas I'm not sure if he just happens to gesture at or was actively thinking about it. I don't know. As said earlier, I feel like there are rabbit holes of interpretation to go down here but I'm unsure how worthwhile they are, and the way he plays with that very dilemma, similarly to Nabokov, is half the fun itself. Regardless, too much attention on these interpretive Q's is misplaced. The transportive power and joy of the city descriptions are unforgettable, and I can't wait to read more in the future.",2019-10-24 02:41:35,5,en,2019-10-24 02:41:35,10,2019,0.00076,0.00012,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,264

Rebecca,"An amazing poetic and fantastic novel in a unique form: a dialogue across time and spaces (now here, now there, or is it just a fabrication of consciousness?) between Kublai Khan, great Mongol emperor, and Marco Polo, his peripatetic ambassador. A meditation on civilization and our conceptions of what it is to be a social creature, an almost dispassionate survey of a myriad possible forms of community and its structures, physical and philosophical.I found many of the conjurations rather terrifying: Calvino's imagery is lush and potent, and he spares no prying look into the hidden horrors of humanity's misery and godless constructs of oppression and immorality. On the other hand, the landscapes of the human mind are infinitely inventive and illuminating: Polo entertains the Great Khan with a tapestry of tales, admittedly many of which are fabricated of whole cloth of which the Khan himself is well aware, and amid the medieval relating of fantastic half-truths along the lines of griffins, horse-headed men and bearded women - a ""lotus-eater"" menagery - are carefully-incorporated mentions of gas stations, electrical inventions and other anachronistic references to spread the story across the whole timespan of human civilization.I quite enjoyed Calvino's gentler novelette, ""The Baron In the Trees"", and was admittedly unprepared for this wider-eyed look into the human heart and mind. It will stay with me for some time while I mull it over and surmount the low-level anxiety it has conjured-up for me.

Jessi,"I haven't been able to sleep recently. I just pop awake around 2am, neither happy nor aghast. The idea of fighting this unwelcome but pervasive state felt impossible- not just in execution but in conceptualization, like inventing a new element. Last night I awoke at the usual time, but was filled with anxiety, on the verge of tears. My thoughts raced horribly and panic seemed to compound itself, until the most banal (albeit lightly pleasant) thought happened to cross my mind. Everything stopped, and I felt my chest open and relax. I fell back asleep. This is obviously an uninteresting and useless anecdote but it is notable to me. To have a single day of two such transcendent, unrelated (?) moments of catharsis, one from a masterful and careful book, and the other physical, inchoate, personal, is something I can't decouple in my mind. This book made me feel a deep loneliness and melancholy, conjuring infinite reflections on the implacable limits of understanding and connection. But it simultaneously put me in a liminal space of imaginative relationships: remembering forgotten experiences, thinking of words I'd heard recently and barely begun to grasp, and of advice I'd vaguely appreciated but now comprehend.I want to share this experience but don't think I can. I'm sure I will re-read this book and I will probably feel completely differently about it when I do.

Scott,"I won't pretend that I fathom everything Calvino was doing with this book, but I can at least recognize its genius.This ""novel"" certainly plays with boundaries. Those between ""novel"" and ""short story collection,"" as well as ""prose"" and ""poetry."" The framing device is Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan about the many fabulous and fantastical cities to be found throughout the aging Khan's vast empire. But it soon becomes clear that this book is not simply some collection of wild tales (though it is that, to a certain extent). Rather, there are high-minded themes of nature, identity, and the existential nature of cities, their denizens, and their perceptions. For those of a philosophical bent, there is plenty of food for thought here. This often belies the dazzling exterior description of the cities, which would typically be things found in the wild tales of fantasy genre or comic book writers and artists. Beyond the cerebral elements, there is an immensely rich and creative use of language here. I can only imagine what it is like in its original Italian, but this English translation is sometimes simply a joy to read. Even in moments when I may not grasp the deeper implications of the wondrous cities' descriptions, the usage and arrangements of words and phrases is compelling. This is a book that I plan to keep, go back to, and draw from again in the future.

Andrin Albrecht,"This book is art, plain and simple.It is not so much a novel as it is a collection of prose poems – very abstract, very philosophical, but also full of simple wonder. I, for one, absolutely love all sorts of anthologies of the fantastic – when I was younger, I could spend hours leafing through lexica of dragons or designing maps of countries that never existed, and already for this basic reason, Calvino's ""Invisible Cities"" is purely magnificent. You get almost a hundred descriptions of imaginary cities, all of which have ostensible parallels to real world cities and especially Venice, but which at the same time consist only of water pipes to accomodate the nymphs that founded it, hang suspended from gigantic spider's webs, move their marble palaces around the contry like attractions of a funfair, and built a mirror city underground to display the corpses of their dead in everyday activities. It's miraculous, beautiful, profound and oftentimes deeply touching. I mean ...""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."" -Italo Calvino, p. 148If this isn't art, I don't know what is.",2019-11-28 14:23:12,5,en,2019-11-28 14:23:12,11,2019,0.00193,0.0001,0.00022,0.00013,0.00022,0.00018,273
Tiffany Low,"Sometimes, I have trouble showing my friends around Seattle because I am afraid that by doing so, I am treading over the thin threads of memories that I have of people that are no longer in my life. I am afraid that the city that we experienced together will cease to exist in my memory— what I failed to realize is that the city in my mind has always been changing, and that it is not the true form. This book read like a bowl of soft, cooked rice. Absolutely delicious and textured— it leaves you turning Calvino’s magical imagery of reality and cities around and around in your mind’s mouth. What is past, present, and future? What are we protecting by naming it something else? What is mimicry, and what is reality? “Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,"" Polo said. ""Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it, or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.” I am afraid of losing some memories of my cities, even if they are painful, but it is the process of holding onto something so tight even though it’s no longer there that causes so much pain. Cities in this book are like people (if they aren’t describing people to begin with). You have to let go the illusion of having control. I really want to read this again in a hard copy again before I give it any ratings, because it is a short book and I think that it deserves more of my attention so that I am listening, rather than just taking what I want.",2022-06-24 01:11:31,0,en,2022-06-24 01:11:31,6,2022,0.001,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,282
elle,"“cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”
  
i adore calvino. i loved cosmicomics, if on a winter's night a traveller, and mr palomar to name a few. he is innovative and smart and spin stories out of quite literally anything and everything.i've had invisible cities on my shelf for a while, but just had time to read this in time for the new year (i wanted to read a couple of stories a day) because the chapters are very short. in the book, a fictional marco polo tells kublai khan of his travels to these imaginary cities. it's extremely experimental, dreamlike, and surreal—especially when you take into account the book's anachronistic elements. all cities are entirely fantastical, but there are elements that we can relate to, because all of these cities represent elements of human nature and philosophy and minds. i loved making connections, piecing together these puzzle pieces that calvino left for the readers.i think there is also a sadness in the fact that kublai khan conquering so much land, so much culture, so many cities that he cannot visit them all—he needs to ask someone else to do so. there is a sort of prideful melancholy in the way he listens and the truth of this situation.however, the writing did get a bit repetitive in the end. calvino usually does, but his other works manage to pull off the repetitiveness with a purposefulness. this one did not really.",2023-01-21 17:55:26,3,en,2023-01-21 17:55:26,1,2023,0.00078,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,264
Saga,"""I speak and speak,"" Marco says, ""but the listener retains only the words he is expecting...""I had only read Spiders' Nests by Calvino before, a novel which tries to be so much it fractures, a pastische-cum-joyride-cum-political-commentary, never committed enough to either but sincere enough to make each part a little bit embarrassing. This one, by contrast, tries many things only briefly and with an irreverent inconsistency that collapses time, space, and power into a postmodern feast, of sorts.At first Invisible Cities seems either a witty puzzle or a nebulous Rubik's cube of a novel. Musing on the difference between the map and the 3D model, a line and a vortex, Calvino guides you through his decaying empires of mnemonic neverspheres like a tourist taking pride in not knowing where they're going. The blurb suggests an elegant Nolan-like (if generous, Coelho-trite if not) twist to the elliptical tales of Marco, though the actual book, for all its clockwork microcosms, breathes truths far weirder than solutions can resolve. The format of a novel doesn't hold it either, for all its mentions of threads its own idea of ""dipping into the ragout"" serves perhaps the better reading approach. There is so much beauty here, but it's poorly appreciated with a surveyor's eye. The memory palace of Invisible Cities only came together for me afyer I'd read it, the book only beautiful in the nostalgia of itself.",2018-04-17 12:51:02,5,en,2018-04-17 12:51:02,4,2018,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,233
Ryan,"This is a short book that I'll most likely have to read again to re-evaluate my opinion. Just from first impressions, this book is teeming with interesting ideas, however you have to chip away at the prose to uncover them. For one example. this book seems to depend heavily on the device of using punchlines to re-frame dozens of preceding details about a given city into a larger idea argument about the nature of a city. That said, as an audio book listener, you don't have much of a warning that these punchlines are approaching so the city descriptions often end rather abruptly, leaving you to rewinding to piece together why this sentence help so much weight. This is also the third out of the last five that I've read that has relied on this trope of 'historical-figures-in-name-only having-'deep'-conversations' as a way to break the forth wall. In fairness, this book was written before the other two (I am a strange loop, the beginning of infinity).'Exhalation' by Ted Chiang is another useful book to compare this work to. Chiang's work focuses more on scientific ideas rather than philosophical ones, however Chiang is able to flesh out equally mind-blowing concepts with completely lucid prose. This may just show my ignorance of literature, but it seems like riddle-like prose was much more popular 50-100 years ago. I'll have to test that by reading some more contemporary magical realism. As I alluded to at the beginning, I am near certain that the book will get better with re-readings, though that's not necessarily a compliment.",2021-01-10 05:12:56,4,en,2021-01-10 05:12:56,1,2021,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,261
Elvin,"This is finely written with a lot of imagination, but it just isn't the type of book I tend to seek out and enjoy. There's not much of a plot and none of the characters are all that engaging. This is a different type of book, one that's more philosophical, focused more on observing cities and how the mind works in the realm of observation and imagination.I do like some of the descriptions--a city constructed on a net, a city built above the trees with pillars holding it up. The flights of fancy can be intriguing. There's the idea that the two characters may be different beings, perhaps beggars having this conversation. And Polo is describing his own Venice when describing each of the cities. So there's some though-provoking things here. And the language is wonderful as well. I can see why many people would like this book.However, I seek a different type of experience in my stories and books. And this didn't satisfy that yearning. The series of descriptions got tiresome. I hoped that the narrative would lead to more action but it didn't. Again, this book is trying something else. The Baron in the Trees is the book that brought me to Calvino. And that work is more to my liking. I will continue exploring his other works in search of a similar experience. Still, I appreciate the experience I had with this book. The imaginary, observant nature of it all has its allure. It's just not my kind of book.",2021-08-05 09:50:04,3,en,2021-08-05 09:50:04,8,2021,0.00162,0.0001,0.00021,0.00011,0.00025,0.00019,253
Vojtěch E. Kilian,"This book was recommended to me by a beautiful Italian girl, and one does not talk back to the beautiful Italian girls... and that was it when I bought it and when I started reading. I knew nothing about the author, nor the book. I was really, surprised by it, as my expectations were completely different, I expected a novel, I got a number of descriptions of fictional (or? are they fictional?) cities connected together by the dialogues of Marco Polo and the Khan. But it was truly a pleasure to read — every described fictional city reflects some features of the real world. In the descriptions, as well as in the dialogues are incorporated brilliant thoughts and remarks. The cities serve as symbols in the book, and not only in the book. The cities are condensed reflections of the world, symbols full of symbols. And the symbols are incredibly important to us as people, as we cannot comprehend the world in full and we are able to perceive only the cut-outs of the entirety. So, the book is — in my opinion — not about the cities, the book is about symbols (even the book itself is a symbol, as it is structured as a staircase, path). And symbols are, what give us orientation in life, in the world, and in the universe. It is well written and I really enjoyed reading it and thinking it through. I found out that I need to study semiology to understand Italian authors of the 20th century though... :)",2022-06-21 15:28:58,5,en,2022-06-21 15:28:58,6,2022,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,257
Vel Veeter,"This book is just not for me. Maybe it plays more than I want it to, maybe it’s been built up by too many people over the years, maybe it’s whimsical and I don’t want whimsical right now, or maybe it’s derivative or copies so much. I think that those people who love this book, and that’s between them and the book, have never played video games before. Stay with me here. In Video Games, comic books, fantasy art, Magic the Gathering, and any other outlet for this kind of fantasizing about the many different worlds that could be.The conceit of this book is that Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are talking and Marco Polo is describing the many many different cities between Italy and Mongolia. Each city has a different name and a different element and it’s not a “each city is more fantastic than the previous one” kind of thing, but instead is more of a rumination on various ideas and themes. Like I said, I was not super sold on it. I won’t tell you the further premise, but there’s a unifying connector between all the different cities and descriptions. I just wasn’t completely charmed by this. For me it reads like less good Borges, who I am already not the biggest fan of in the world. I like Borges, but he’s simply just better than this. I will hand this off to someone who might want it though.",2017-12-19 23:11:40,2,en,2017-12-19 23:11:40,12,2017,0.00123,0.00011,0.00021,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,242
Victoria,"i still don't know what's happening but that's the point. at first when i started i was sort of impatient and couldn't understand the rave reviews, and then as i got deeper and more lost in the catalogue of dream-cities/city-dreams (because that's what the book is) i began to appreciate more and more the prose. the cities remind me of that limbo landscape in inception: amorphous, crumbling, provoking because they make you question your idea of time and form and space. i like this book a lot better than on a winter's night a traveler, because it's less presumptuous. it gives you room to breathe (no pun intended.) that being said, what bothers me about it is what bothers me about calvino's work in general: if cities are mirrors are dreams are people, then it is super telling that these cities are always full of naked, bathing, beautiful, silent women, or named after women (chloe, clarice, theodora, zoe, andria, etc.) there's even a city that's built because men dreamt of chasing a woman in a city and they built the city to reflect the dream-city but also to trap this dream-woman. if the point of this book that people are cities onto themselves and ultimately build what they dream and perceive (not necessarily as architects but as people who shape the lives of others around them), then why are women objects of dreams and not the dreamers themselves?",2019-06-06 08:12:49,3,en,2019-06-06 08:12:49,6,2019,0.00142,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.0002,0.00017,238
Sandra Ramirez,"I am currently listening to ""A Day's Read"" by The Great Courses on Audible, and this book is one discussed in it. It is a very short book and can be read in a day, though I took 5 days, I had been busy at work. Anyway, it is an unusual book, and for that alone, I would recommend it to some people. If you like poetic prose, you will love this book, it is chuck full of it, so much that I would compare it to finding the photo collection of a stranger from childhood to senior years, it is that full of poetic prose, metaphors, and symbols with hardly any narrated plot. Even the 2 characters, Marco Polo and the Great Khan Kublai, are only slightly based on the historical people, with Marco Polo at one point describing airports and communication towers. As I understood this book, the author takes the reader through childhood's fantastical and exciting view of the world, through the adult's more realistic view, to old age's acceptance that our time is passed, and the hopes and fears of what will come in the future to the next generation. But you could read this book and get something completely different. I think the best quote from Invisible Cities to describe it, is the following: ""I speak and speak,' Marco says, 'but the listener retains only the words he is expecting [...] It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""",2019-10-30 23:07:42,3,en,2019-10-30 23:07:42,10,2019,0.00056,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,249
Jan David,"This book has truly been a surprise. I started reading it as part of a larger bundle of books I got, and without knowing what to expect. And I have to say, very rarely did a book manage to get me hooked so completely as this one.Unexpectedly, this book touched me deeply. Without warning, it started asking existential questions through the stories it told. The descriptions of the cities made me consider my own life, the decisions I made in the past, and the decisions I will make in the future. As someone who has moved a lot and left his home country, I suddenly felt a sense of loss and sadness, and painfully aware of being a visitor in my city and a traveler, who before long, might leave for another place.And yet, at the same time, the book made me excited for what is to come as well. Through asking existential questions, I felt put on a path to discover certain truths about myself. Just as the traveler in the book, it will take time for me to get to the next point. But I thoroughly enjoy the ideas and challenges the book has given me.I can highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in introspection and reflection. It must be read with an open mind, and it might still not have the same effect than it did on me.

Arukiyomi,"Such a little book for so much metaphor. Calvino writes prose that, on the surface of it, is deceptively simple. It’s a lot easier to read than much of Borges stuff too, but it packs just as much metaphysics into each sentence.Each of the 55 descriptions begins by naming the city (always female) and highlighting what makes it unique. These range from the mundane to the outright fantastical and are distributed through the book in a carefully structured way which this Wikipedia chart helpfully illustrates.The book is essentially a collection of descriptions of cities that Marco Polo has encountered on his travels and which he relates to Kublai Khan. The cities can be taken individually or considered as variations of one.I’m not entirely sure what the mathematical arrangement of cities is meant to mean to the reader. The descriptions are interesting in themselves and you can read into them as little or as much as you want.I didn’t come away from the book with anywhere near the impression that I did with If on a winter’s night a traveller… and was disappointed by that. This felt a lot more serious than traveller… and that left me feeling like I should have somehow done more than simply just read it.But at least I have read it.For more reviews and the 1001 Books Spreadsheet, visit http://arukiyomi.com",2020-12-27 22:32:10,3,en,2020-12-27 22:32:10,12,2020,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,224
Tati,"A year after it was cut from my Western Literature class’s syllabus I have finally gotten around to reading it and I am so glad I did. I wish I had read it in class and was able to listen to lectures on it and have discussions about it but I suppose this will do. It is a beautifully written book, prosaic with a mathematical organization that set up the philosophical ending to be just the right kind of gut punch. Marco Polo’s wild descriptions of different fantastical cities that each have their own issues and magical elements to them is intertwined with his conversations with Kublai Khan pondering the end of his empire and whether or not the places Polo describes are real, accessible, or maybe even the same place. It’s a pretty quick read, but I would highly recommend it. I personally liked getting through it in basically one big chunk as I never lost my momentum and feel I was able to see the larger picture a bit more cohesively. But, I did often find myself rereading passages or even while chapters just to really think more about what Calvino was saying. In the future I kind of think a fun activity would actually be to write out each city and figure out exactly WHY that city and what the point of each chapter is; in a way I would like to work on each mini thought experiment Calvino poses in each chapter via a new city.",2021-01-13 06:43:27,5,en,2021-01-13 06:43:27,1,2021,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,250
Alice Gould,"I have a theory that no one actually likes Calvino.It is a faux pas to criticize him, we're all too scared to be caught out as ""not getting"" his works. We don't, we won't, admit it.I do not get Calvino.I hated ""On a winter's night a traveller"". I found it pretentious, masculnormative and essentially a novel that may as well just have been the words ""I'm so clever, I'm such a good writer, this concept is so good"" for 300 pages. A friend told me Invisible Cities would be different. I love Venice, I used to live in Venice, I love reading anything about or set in Venice. It's such a complex, contradictory city that I thought that the concept of writing about a multitude of different cities that, in fact, are all one city could really work. Maybe it does. Maybe I'm not smart enough for Calvino. But I found the whole thing pointless, repetitive and dull. There were about 10 chapters I enjoyed, that did describe parts of Venice. The rest was all overwritten, over thought out nonsense, style over substance.I would have given it 2 stars of not for this passage, which is beautiful and gives the novel some point:""Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances [...] Your atlas preserves the differences intact"".And even then, i had to cut out a middle section to like it.",2021-06-14 00:22:45,3,en,2021-06-14 00:22:45,6,2021,0.00109,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,242
Wuf,"To be truthful I've picked up and put down this book multiple times over the years trying to finish it. I first picked it up after reading the webcomic Hero, the author of which wrote about this book being inspiration for their own work. The idea is intriguing. The book is surreal and odd, the writing often abstract and sumptuous. Marco Polo speaks to Kublai Kahn about cities out of myth and history, mixing the ancient with airports, cranes, and modern technology. Other reviewers have said that it can get repetitive, and that's true. Some of the cities really interested me, and moved me, but others didn't much catch my interest. It was for sure a mixed bag and I do feel like it could have done with being a bit shorter. The ending also sort of petered out a bit. I would have liked to see more of a shift toward the parts between Marco and Kublai more by that point.I really did like the sections that start with 'The Khan has an atlas...' which, shockingly, outline real places. Aside from these fantastical cities described by Polo the book speaks of New York, San Francisco, Paris, Jerusalem, Kyoto. And later these meld into cities that do not exist, Atlantis, Utopia, Brave New World. That moved me, and I really enjoyed it. This book is short, but dense, and there isn't what I'd call 'action'.

Jacca,"This is going to gain value from a re-read or perhaps a few (easily done as it's so short).Once again Calvino has surprised me and, once again, it has an entirely unique basis. This isn't a novel in the plain sense at all (unless you really want to consider it as one by using the somewhat detached conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan as a central plot device). It's more like a series of individual ruminations all using the description of a distant and alien city to recall something strangely familiar, either through very direct descriptions of experience and sights in a city or through far more abstract visions.Each city is told through Marco Polo's memories of a particular city and there lies the defining elements of cities - social and architectural, the journey to and through them, the things you do and the things the city does - that build your experience of each one through the memory of others. I like how they are individual meditations that stand alone so powerfully but that inevitably interlace.I read this quickly before leaving as I couldn't take it with me and so it's sitting on a shelf waiting for me to revisit it and take my time with it to truly appreciate it.

In the square there is a wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.”“….sometimes different cities follow one another on the same site and under the same name, both and dying without knowing one another, without communication among themselves.”“Valdrada's inhabitants know that each of their actions is, at once, that action and its mirror-image, which possesses the special dignity of images, and this awareness prevents them from succumbing for a single moment to chance and forgetfulness. Even when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the position that will give one the most pleasure in the other, even when murderers plunge the knife into the black veins of the neck and more clotted blood pours out the more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so much their copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering of the images, limpid and cold in the mirror.”",2022-09-06 05:26:18,3,en,2022-09-06 05:26:18,9,2022,0.00372,0.00013,0.00037,0.00017,0.00029,0.00023,222
Foster Hudson,"Of all the strange concepts for a book in existence, a fictitious conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan about cities that may or may not exist must be high on the list. Despite this, Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino manages to be one of the most personal and tangible books I've ever read. The novel is essentially a series of vignettes, each a description of a city Marco Polo has visited on behalf of Kublai Khan. You soon found out, however, that these cities are more surreal than real. The novel is all the better for it, as each description is brimming with beauty and imagination. Every city in the novel has one specific characteristic that makes it unique, each of which is extremely creative. What's most impressive and engaging about Invisible Cities, however, is what Italo Calvino does with these descriptions. Each study functions as a parable, or at the very least an insight, into human nature. Some are able to get pretty introspective, while others very emotional, and as a whole the cities are able to create a beautiful and deeply moving portrait of human existence. It's very rare to find a book like Invisible Cities, one that is able to resonate with you so personally and so creatively.",2017-05-31 11:23:19,5,en,2017-05-31 11:23:19,5,2017,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,212
Adam O'Leary,"Invisible Cities is a series of dialogues between Marco Polo and the Kublai Kahn, in which Polo describes the cities of his travels to the fascinated emperor. Or so it purports to be, as all of the cities are confections of Marco Polo, taking Venice as a model for the multitude of improbable cities he describes. Indeed, Marco Polo is unconstrained by time, space, or physics in the describing of these wonderful and haunting places, as he describes airports, people listening to the radio and riding trains and trams amongst the desert caravan stations and sailing ports of the Mediterranean. This work is a beautiful collection of philosophical musings on the experience of the city, the great hub of modernity, and most cities have a person's name that implies the unique human experience of every city, which means no person experiences a place in the same way as another. Calvino touches on themes of individuality, conviviality, environmentalism, death, history, archaeology and probably a whole host more topics that will become apparent to me with a second reading, in ways that linger in the soul.

It raises questions like, How are we to distinguish between the real and the fantastic? How are we to understand the world if we can only see a small part of it in our lifetimes? And what the hell is a journey? Does it necessarily have a beginning or an end? Can you visit a place without physically being there? Is everywhere actually somewhere else?Why cities? A city can take on myriad different forms; as long as people live in a place, or once lived in a place, you could call it a city. Calvino shows us how features of cities impact the people living in them. It's surreal in the best possible way.Framing the work is a conversation between Marco Polo and Genghis Khan. The old emperor listens to the young traveler's descriptions of cities in the Tartar dominion. It feels like an eternal sunset hovers over the book. Genghis has his best days behind him, yet he is just starting to realize, with the help of Marco's stories, what his empire truly is. This strange companionship (and nod to history) gives the novel depth, mystery, and emotion.I love cities. This book has justified my belief.",2017-08-30 07:29:54,5,en,2017-08-30 07:29:54,8,2017,0.00081,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00017,0.00014,220
Chris Gilmore,"Imagine, if you will, a garden in Inner Mongolia where Kublai Khan sits in repose to take a quiet interlude with his widely traveled friend, Marco Polo. Seeking both meaning and diversion, Kublai asks his friend to tell him of the wondrous cities in his vast empire which he is too busy to visit. And at times, because he has a playful mind, Kublai instead describes cities of his dreams, and asks Polo to put a name to them. And so they pass a pleasant afternoon, lost in nouns, adjectives, verbs, and wonderment. That is what it is to read Invisible Cities.Invisible Cities is a collection of brief but imaginary city descriptions, classed according to their thickness, how they deal with their dead, or the nature of their skies - or by how their citizens trade, desire, or remember. Between the descriptions, we catch glimpses of Kublai and Marco's teasingly philosophical discussions. The descriptions are wonderful, poetic, creative... take, for example, Armilla (THIN CITIES 3)Whether Armilla is like this because it is unfinished or because it has been demolished, whether the cause is some enchantment or only a whim, I do not know. The fact remains that it has no walls, no ceilings, no floors: it has nothing that makes it seem a city except the water pipes that rise vertically where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors should be: a forest of pipes that end in taps, showers, spouts, overflows. Against the sky a lavabo's white stands out, or a bathtub, or some other porcelain, like late fruit still hanging from the boughs. You would think that the plumbers had finished their job and gone away before the bricklayers arrived; or else their hydraulic systems, indestructible, had survived a catastrophe, an earthquake, or the corrosion of termites. Abandoned before or after it was inhabited, Armilla cannot be called deserted. At any hour, raising your eyes among the pipes, you are likely to glimpse a young woman, or many young women, slender, not tall of stature, luxuriating in the bathtubs or arching their backs under the showers suspended in the void, washing or drying or perfuming themselves, or combing their long hair at a mirror. In the sun, the threads of water fanning from the showers glisten, the jets of the taps, the spurts, the splashes, the sponges' suds.I have come to this explanation: the streams of water channeled in the pipes of Armilla have remained in the possession of nymphs and naiads. Accustomed to traveling along underground veins, they found it easy to enter the new aquatic realm, to burst from multiple fountains, to find new mirrors, new games, new ways of enjoying the water. Their invasion may have driven out the human beings, or Armilla may have been built by humans as a votive offering to win the favor of the nymphs, offended at the misuse of the waters. In any case, now they seem content, these maidens: in the morning you hear them singing.Next, consider Perinthia (CITIES &amp; THE SKY 4), which was precisely laid out by astronomers to respond to the constellations, occultations, decumanus, and cardo of the night sky - to completely and perfectly reflect the will of the gods as it is written in the heavens. And yet today, the city is full in imperfect people.But the worst of its citizens cannot be seen; guttural howls are heard from cellars and lofts, where families hide children with three heads or with six legs. Perinthia's astronomers are faced with a difficult choice. Either they must admit that all their calculations were wrong and their figures are unable to describe the heavens, or else they must reveal that the order of the gods is reflected exactly in this city of monsters.Consider also Penthesilea (CONTINUOUS CITIES 5) which was surely modelled after Phoenix, Arizona:And so you continue, passing from outskirts to outskirts, and the time comes to leave Penthesilea. You ask for the road out of the city; you pass again the string of scattered suburbs like a freckled pigmentation; night falls; windows come alight, here more concentrated, sparser there.You have given up trying to understand whether, hidden in some sac or wrinkle of these dilapidated surroundings there exists a Penthesilea the visitor can recognize and remember, or whether Penthesilea is only the outskirts itself.And lastly Pyyrha, which perhaps more than any city captures the spirit of this book, for it is about places that can only exist in the imagination. Have you ever imagined a city, only to visit it and have the imagined city dissolve before you like cotton candy on a rainy day, to be replaced by something else?Pyrrha (CITIES &amp; NAMES 3)For a long time Pyrrha to me was a fortified city on the slopes of a bay, with high windows and towers, enclosed like a goblet, with a central square deep as a well, with a well in its center. I had never seen it. It was one of the many cities where I had never arrived, that I conjured up, through its name, unmistakable to the mind's eye.The day came when my travels took me to Pyrrha. As soon as I set foot there, everything I had imagined was forgotten; Pyrrha had become what is Pyrrha; and I thought I had always known that the sea is invisible from the city, hidden behind a dune of the low, rolling coast; that the streets are long and straight; that the houses are clumped at intervals, not high, and they are separated by open lots with stacks of lumber and with sawmills; that the wind stirs the vanes of the water pumps. From that moment on the name Pyrrha has brought to my mind this view, this light, this buzzing, this air in which a yellowish dust flies: obviously the name means this and could mean nothing but this.My mind goes on containing a great number of cities I have never seen and will never see, names that bear with them a figure or a fragment or glimmer of an imagined figure. The city high above the bay is also there still, with the square enclosing the well, but I can no longer call it by name, nor remember how I could ever have given it a name that means something entirely different.Invisible cities is highly recommended to dreamers, thinkers, and world-builders.",2017-12-29 11:47:56,5,en,2017-12-29 11:47:56,12,2017,0.0011,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.0002,0.00017,1064
Peter,"Tired of visiting the cities of the Khan's empire, Polo packed up his compass, his pipe, his maps and charts made illegible from years of overuse and exposure to the sun, his perfumed sitting pillow, and four changes of clothes for all occasions. He dragged his traveling case from the palace, and boarded the train leaving Venice bound for Vienna, to hear the music, because Marco Polo was tired of talking, and he wanted to sit in a great hall, and let the reverberations of man's greatest creative accomplishments wash over him as he sipped some tea and let his throat heal. The train stopped in a small mountain village before the border, and Marco got off the train to breath some fresh air. The train left without him, and instead of waiting for the next one, he hired a donkey, and a cart, and began hauling large stones from a rockslide into the village, to build walls, to build a new city, because cities were all he knew. It was very hard work, and the people in the village were not cooperative and did not offer to help. They did not need a new cathedral they said, they did not need walls, or a great market. Go away, they said, go listen to some Handel before the music season is over.",2018-03-31 01:01:35,5,en,2018-03-31 01:01:35,3,2018,0.00191,0.00012,0.00023,0.00014,0.00025,0.00022,222
Andrew,"I have to admit this book stumped me. It is very beautifully written and on the surface it is tightly structured with a clear theme. The narrative exchanges between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan act to bind it together.However, below the surface the intent varies from puzzling to baffling. Some of the “cities” have obvious starting points like tube maps or catacombs. Others are repetitive. A lot of them border on banal.Likewise, it is clear Kublai Khan is reflecting on the meaning of his empire’s diversity. And that Marco Polo knows he is showing off his storytelling art. But so what?Because it was so unclear (to me) how to fit together the many jigsaw-like pieces into a coherent picture, the book becomes a sketchbook, portfolio montage and collection of prose poems.My best attempt at an explanation is that we have a sourcebook of short story ideas made from the highest quality of ingredients. Yet, these have been concentrated down so far to their essential oils that they have lost any subtlety or texture.After finishing, I found several other three star reviews that are insightful in their equivalent reaction. Dan and JG Keely echoed my thoughts. The spoof by Paul on Nottingham sums it up and should not be missed.",2018-08-12 07:21:15,3,en,2018-08-12 07:21:15,8,2018,0.00079,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,209
Ateet,"Calvino is an author I have long yearned to read. For the longest time I had read more about Calvino than his works themselves. And heard a lot. From friends. Fellow Bibliophiles. And the image in my mind was that of an author who wears his greatness lightly. One of those true stalwarts who weave magic out of the ordinary with the insight of the wise and the coaxing of language's true potential. It is with this in my mind, I began reading this book almost a year ago in Venice. It intrigued me immediately. The imagination was far-reaching in space, time and other dimensions it may be hard to define. The conversations between Marco and Kublai were timeless philosophical ruminations yet not divorced from their context of the all conquering Mongol and good friend, the great Italian traveler. But something was amiss. Something that led me to read it in short bursts interspersed by long gaps if absence. Something that could tie all of this into a larger canvas. Make it more satisfying than flashes of profound brilliance amid a sea of voices creativity. I couldn't find it and maybe that's just me. And perhaps that's why I felt that while this was wonderful reading it may not have been definitive Calvino. That one's yet to come for me.",2018-09-08 15:34:38,4,en,2018-09-08 15:34:38,9,2018,0.00066,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,220
Julia,"I have mixed feelings towards Calvino. I think this book is extremely well written and an interesting one but I feel I did not enjoy it as much as I wanted to. ""Invisible Cities"" is an extremely interesting approach towards the desciption of journeys of Marco Polo. We have here Marco Polo as a narrator as well, and he explains his jounreys to different cities to Kublai Khan, a Chinese ruler. BUT! he never explains how to get there, but rather describes cities, in such a magical and fantastical way, it feels almost to be a part of a fable, myth. I really liked this twist on Marco Polo stories (as they are quite boring to me). Moreover, the structure of this book is quite surprising too - the stories are numbered according to different categories, such as Cities &amp; Sky, Cities and Death etc and you can either reader as it goes but also you can jump around the book, reading all the categories separately. It invites you to explore on your own, ""travel"" through the book, as you would do going from a city to a city. It is very philosophical, heavily influenced not only by history, but also mythology, literature, tales. Worth a read, as it is something different, but maybe does not fit everyone.",2019-01-05 05:49:53,4,en,2019-01-05 05:49:53,1,2019,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,218
Neil Fitzgerald,"Not bad, but I confess I'm a little disappointed. This book seemed squarely in my wheelhouse, and yet it passed through me without leaving too much of an impression.The concept is cute - Marco Polo describes different cities to Kublai Khan, which gives Calvino an excuse to tell a series of Borges-esque short-story/thought-experiments. Initially the cities are just cities - in the early parts, he's riffing on the fantastical account in The Travels of Marco Polo, so everything has precious metals, camels, and gratuitous naked ladies. It soon becomes clear that the cities represent something more - knowledge? The human experience? And the stories become more abstract (for the better, I think).I found the stories to be a bit of a mixed bag. Many of them are actually strikingly beautiful - I liked Maurilia (the postcard city), Ersilia (the web-of-relationships city), Melania (the dialogue city), Leonia (the trash city), Cecilia (the endless city). On the other hand, many of them lean on recursion and Inception-esque ""who even knows what's real"" kinda stuff, which I don't care for. More annoyingly to me, many of them lean on the tactic of describing two things, implying that one of them is true, and then TWIST ENDING it's the other one. It's clever the first time or two but soon becomes a bit predictable. At its worst, it reads like M. Night Shyamalan doing Ficciones.I am also not really clear on how these tales tie together. I have the sneaking suspicion that our friend Italo just threw a bunch of stories together and slapped a mathematical ordering system on them. But maybe there's some cleverness that I missed.But hey, at least you can't accuse Invisible Cities of overstaying its welcome - it comes in, drops a few beautiful moments on you, and then bang you're done. And it reminded me that Ficciones is awesome and I should re-read it.",2019-05-14 12:22:09,3,en,2019-05-14 12:22:09,5,2019,0.00102,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,315
Kalyani Ravindharan,"The novel reads like a travelogue which simple guides the audience to a specific part of the world through a specific impetus for a journey. An quintessential part of this sort of travel firing is the great amount of faith that the reader rests in the author to retell his experience as truthfully as possible. It is up to the narrator to mediate his travelled experience with the readers’ familiarity with the landscape. If the audience actually believe what they are reading then that it is testimony of the narrator’s authenticity.However, what if a fictionalised travel narrative contains more Truth than a traditional travelogue. What if the imagined could be more authentic than facts? These are the questions that this short novel poses to the readers. Italo Calvino never claims for the novel to be anything more than fiction and in fact the cities he describes are in fact invisible. Nonetheless, he crafts his work in such a way that questions the possibility that the narrator many not have visited the places that he is describing. Through his novella, Calvino suggests that perhaps the fact that the narrator might or might have been to the places that he describes should not affect the authenticity of the novel.",2021-02-05 16:37:11,4,en,2021-02-05 16:37:11,2,2021,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,207
Aaron,"Wow, one of the best I've read in awhile. great descriptions and some deep, vibrant thinking interwoven that pops in unexpectedly from description to description to description. This is an alltime great. It felt like the book was written from notes kept on one wild day and night roaming and foraging through Venice's alleys, canals and memories.""Arriving at each new city, the traveller finds again a past of histhat he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.Marco enters a city: he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his ; he could now be in that man's place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.""Journeys to relive your past?"" was the Khan 's question at this point, a question which could also have been formulated: ""Journeys to recover your future?""And Marco's answer was: ""Elsewhere is a negative mirror.

Natasha,"I struggle to find words to describe this book. The book which is framed as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where he describes various cities that he encountered on his travels. Each of the 55 cities is virtually a prose poem, and in reading them, you end up reflecting on death, time, and human experiences. One tiny excerpt will explain better than words ever could.Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. “But which is the stone that supports the bridge?” Kubla Khan asks.“The bridge is not supported by one stone or another”, Marco answers, “but by the line of the arch that they form.”Kulba khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: “Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.”Polo answers: “Without stones, there is no arch.""What was not immediately apparent was the structure of the book. The 55 cities are divided into 11 thematic groups of 5 cities each, which are arranged in a strict mathematical structure. When you notice the pattern of repetitions and figure out the pattern, the book lifts itself to the sublime.A book unlike any other I have read.

Veronica,"Marco Polo describes the cities he has seen during his travels to the Chinese emperor Kublai Khan. Slowly we’ve come to learn that Marco Polo is, in fact, describing only one city; the city of Venice. Wow, what a book. Maybe I shouldn’t have tried to finish it in a rush when my post-Covid brain is struggling to string together two words. Invisibile Cities by Italo Calvino is unlike any other book I’ve ever read before. It’s a beautiful book, magical even. And the best part is that I read a part of this book while I’m in Venice which definitely enhances the experience. Here’s an extract from my favourite chapter. “Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man's place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in the square.

Jaron,"a review for this one criticizes it for relying too much on Coelho-esque platitudes, and sadly i gotta agree. there is some really good stuff—the intro is brilliant, and some of the city descriptions are truly spectacularly imagined and rendered—but i can’t help but think the universal praise for this book comes from the bleary-eyed approval of comfy middle-class liberal folks that find themselves stupefied—and, in turn, transcending—by the strange pseudo-aphorisms strewn throughout the work. the reality is calvino ultimately makes himself look a little silly by making his characters speak like ancient sages—such writing works perhaps only when it is removed from us by a few thousand years (and even then, some reservations are probably not unhealthy...)there’s no story—nor does there need to be—but to call the city descriptions a collection of “prose poems” seems a stretch—is this poetry, a conglomeration of half-assed descriptions related in quasi-mystical terms? there is enough here to satisfy the wisdom-hungry West drunk on the superficialities of New Age mysticism, but not much for any self-respecting reader. the idea behind the book is marvelous, the execution lackluster in the end—nonetheless, the read was fun (still give it one, maybe, or do not…)",2022-05-29 01:19:16,2,en,2022-05-29 01:19:16,5,2022,0.00348,0.00011,0.00036,0.00012,0.0003,0.0002,198

The characters seem elusive yet philosophical in their conversation and they depict vivid yet vague pictures of cosmopolitan areas that sometimes do not make sense in real life. Yet I enjoy imagining them and all the odd things happening in them.My favorite city is Adelma in which we could meet the dead. At one point, he doubted at which end of the dichotomy it is.

In either case it is best for me not to insist on staring at them.""I enjoy reading about the peculiar occurrences in this book.

Mai,"Calvino paints cities in your mind, using words. Each city unique, with its own quirks, its own secrets. A book that has to be experienced, and also one that has to be read multiple times. Reminds you what it is like to experience a new culture for the first time, or hear about an ancient culture, now only preserved in museums, stories and paintings, for the first time. Or how it was as a child to read about a mythical place in a story and never to question whether it exists or not - of course it does! Maybe not in this world, or maybe not physically, but it does. Reminds you that each city has its own feel, its own soul - we usually forget about that, don't we? It's hard, if not impossible, to see your hometown through the eyes of someone who's never been there before, to describe it.(Also, now I really appreciate having taken an art history course, because I understand a heck of a lot more architecture terms used in this book than if I hadn't taken one. If you're not familiar with what parts of buildings are called, might want to keep Google handy while reading. It will enhance the experience, quite possibly.)",2019-02-11 23:23:39,5,en,2019-02-11 23:23:39,2,2019,0.00069,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,209

Marco explains various rules regarding the cities whilst talking to the Khan, going down often labyrinthine explanations of the conditions of never finding the same city twice and of no two cities being the same ever.I was initially put off thinking that this may be too dense for me but the translation by William Weaver is fresh and readable making the whole book so accessible.Each city is so wondrous that I didn't put the book down until I had finished and had to read it a second time straight after finishing the first reading.",2020-01-21 22:48:29,4,en,2020-01-21 22:48:29,1,2020,0.0006,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,187
Sophia Leiker,"While reading this book, one highly recommended to me by a friend, I began jotting down some of my favorite quotes. I caught myself pulling out pieces from almost every city, as the writing paints a picture of cities which feel both both incredibly familiar as well as distant and foreign. A great read which inspires me to once again travel to new and unfamiliar places. “Each city received its form from the desert it opposes; and so the camel driver and the sailor see Despina, a border city between two deserts”“The more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, The more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrive there; and he retraced the stages of his journeys, and he came to know the port from which he had set sail, and the familiar places of his youth, in the surroundings of home, and a little square Venice where he gambled as a child”“The twin cities are not equal, because nothing that exists or happens in Valdrada is symmetrical: every face and gesture is answered, from the mirror, by a face and gesture inverted, point by point.

O,"In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city’s life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.From a mountainside, camping with their household goods, Ersilia’s refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing.They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still farther away.Thus, when traveling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of the abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate relationships seeking a form.",2020-04-15 00:14:24,4,en,2020-04-15 00:14:24,4,2020,0.00096,0.00011,0.00017,0.00013,0.00019,0.00017,185
Jean Dupenloup,"Why in the world is this book so popular? Italo Calvino’s most celebrated work left me stunned and missing a few brain cells.Reading Invisible Cities is like drinking a glass of water. It has no taste or color or spice or odor, but it feels fine and even kind of refreshing.However, the book is a senseless allegory full of easy cliches and forgettable metaphors, and I am convinced its popularity rests solely on three factors: 1) It has the good taste of being very short, with many spacings between very short chapters. It’s insanely readable for all the barely literate masses. 2) The ideas expressed are so toothless that the pretty imagery can be quoted without risk of offending, instigating, or provoking a single original thought. 3) Its symbolism is so insipid and shallow no one need pretend to understand it, and would-be mystics around college campuses can proudly display it in their dorm rooms the world over and act like an intellectual.

Adam,"Oh boy. This was not a good choice for an audiobook. How to describe this book? The synopsis describes it as a ‘compilation of fragmentary urban images,” which seems about right.Basically, Marco Polo is telling stories to Kublai Kahn about the cities that he has encountered during his travels. Except Polo is just embellishing wildly and his cities are nonsensical, impossible even. Sometimes Kublai interrupts him, sometimes Polo interrupts himself, sometimes he interrupts Kublai? Then more nonsense about cities, their inhabitants, dreams, their clothes, the architecture, city-planning, and so on. Calvino writes eloquently, beautifully, descriptively, about nothing. What is the point of it all? Honestly, I have no idea. My mate, who’s smarter than me, described the book as esoteric. That seems fair. Reading other’s reviews tells me there’s a point in there, somewhere, but it’s not for me to grasp nor explain. I suppose it’s a bit like quantum physics: it might be interesting, but don’t ask me to explain it to you.

Alexander Miles,"Note: I read the William Weaver translation.This was an interesting one, I actually can't recall how it made it onto our reading list, but I'm glad it did. The book is framed as a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn, describing the innumerable cities that Marco Polo has seen and experienced during his travels. Even within the conceit of the book, it's revealed that these cities don't always exist, by that point the reader can see that they don't really need to. Each city is described in just a few pages, most of them given women's names (possibly all, though names I'm less familiar with), and all having some very particular defining characteristic. They read almost like bedtime stories for children, stories of far-away lands with unbelievable features, but somehow more dreamlike than I can convey. In practice these descriptions of cities serve as meditations on bits of human experience and pondering on what it means for a place to become a ""city."" I thoroughly enjoyed the book, there are a handful of the sections hit me like a freight train; that I keep returning to again and again. I absolutely want to read more from Calvino in the future.",2021-07-01 00:33:27,5,en,2021-07-01 00:33:27,7,2021,0.00059,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,201

I am getting more into Italian literature and am looking forward to reading more of Calvino's works. How incredible to have a meditation on place and memory and dreams, three abstract yet integrated phenomena that define our lives in unspeakable ways, certainly in ways that I thought would be restricted by the confines of language- but in fact, Calvino weaves together the impossible into the real in glittering prose that makes me think, even just for a moment, that perhaps in a past life I was living among our world's rich history, the likes of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan.",2021-07-26 21:54:15,4,en,2021-07-26 21:54:15,7,2021,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,193
Ana Cretu,"I appreciate the imagination, creativity and the beautiful execution. And I do enjoy metaphors and abstract concepts, but to me, this novel became repetitive very quickly. There is no plot, the entire book is almost a repository of imagined cities, one per page.

Prooost Davis,"For me, Invisible Cities was a journey from bafflement, through occasional boredom, to exasperation.Marco Polo is describing cities he has visited to Kublai Khan. The cities are all the products of Italo Calvino's imagination, and they are strange, alternate realities. Perhaps mine was not the proper approach to the novel, but I kept trying to find meaning, or a message. If there is one, perhaps others have found the key to it.Wikipedia calls the book a prose poem, which is not a bad description; it is full of vivid images. Wikipedia also places Calvino in the OuLiPo school, the English translation of which is ""workshop of potential literature."" The authors have tried to find new ways of telling stories. The reader, as I understand it, engages in a game with the author, who has left a puzzle. In the Wikipedia page for Invisible Cities, there is a matrix which explains the mathematical structure of the chapters. I applaud the OuLiPo writers for trying new things, but the few things I've read by them have not been too my taste, although I have to say I quite enjoyed Calvino's If on a winter's night a traveler.",2021-10-12 06:38:40,3,en,2021-10-12 06:38:40,10,2021,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,195
Jack Lyell,"""And Polo said: 'The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.'""Few books contain this one's ability to evoke image. The fantasy of the story emerges like a young thing erupting from its shell, beginning with the almost-real place and travelling with us into the impossible place, alive in both the actual descriptions it offers and the meta-narrative of what it means to move from place to place. Like Borges's best, has a way of turning reality inside out on you, to reveal some sparkling thing underneath the surface that you feel as if some part of you must have always known.

Jocelyn,"I tried, I really tried, and this is not the first time I've tried with Calvino. My spouse (a philosopher of language) adores Calvino; his erstwhile dissertation director (the same make) counts this as one of his favorite books. I completely get why *they* like him, and this; he's practically made up of thought experiments wrapped in crystalline language, perfect for minds who thrive on turning over abstract ideas. I did okay to about the halfway point - five stars to the halfway point, seriously - and then the form really began to wear on me. I continued to appreciate the shifting framing dialogues of Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, even as I struggled to keep on with the cities. But one of the problems with Calvino for me is that it's so easy to come to a natural stopping point and to stop, and I kept doing that, and it took me five days to get through this when it was really only a couple hours worth of reading. Paradoxically, I think I might have done better if I tried to read this incredibly slowly, like one city a day, one city a week, but I didn't have the patience to leach it out like that.",2022-09-20 09:02:57,3,en,2022-09-20 09:02:57,9,2022,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,207
Filippo Agostino,"I find this book beautiful and balanced. Fifty five flash stories, all with roughly the same plot yet never boring, each unique in a way.Not all the stories have the same purpose: some of them convey a message, whether implicit or explicit; others present an absurd, surrealist scenario, that is simply fun to read; and still others (but this is just a personal interpretation) exist to make you think. Each time I finished a chapter, I put down the book for a few seconds to reflect. I wondered what the pages I had just read meant, if I had interpreted them correctly, if they even had a moral or were there just for fun.And I say this as a positive. When you read this book, you have an active role in it. Some people say that the new edition should feature an appendix after each story to help you decipher it; while this is a reasonable opinion, I personally enjoyed having to reflect.I also loved the surrealistic and anachronistic style, the unconventional structure, and the prose (I read it in Italian, but I'm sure the translator must have done a great job).If you want something to chew on, I recommend it.",2022-10-31 23:58:57,5,en,2022-10-31 23:58:57,10,2022,0.00054,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,201

Roberto,"The idea of this unusual book is great. It's a kind of dreaming conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. The traveller describes a huge number of cities, giving his version of the trip he's done. The descriptions are incredible, of cities coming from dreams, from another world. They become the prototype of real places, but totally impossible to exist in the real life. Also the organisation of the stories is unusual, divided in categories and then mixed up. A couple of times, the narrator tells that Polo and Khan don't speak the same language when they discuss these trip, and that makes the sense of the dream even more involving.The remarkable quote about the arch and the stone I think it's worth the price of the book.However, it's not an easy reading. I should have needed a guide book next to me, something to understand the interpretation of these stories. I can give my personal point of view, but most times I lost track of the descriptions – too airy, abstract, even difficult to imagine. I couldn't even figure out what the point was of some of them – and I think I won't remember any of them.",2022-12-06 02:30:22,3,en,2022-12-06 02:30:22,12,2022,0.00056,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,199
Paul,"It would feel wrong of me to accredit this with more than 3 stars, as simply put I didn't ""get it"".But then it dawned on me, is there anything really to get. Apparently, all cities are Venice, well having visited Venice on multiple occasions and read about it profusely over the years I could only discern something like a Venice in 5-6 of them, maybe 8 at a push.Instead it came to be that Calvino is attempting to suggest that cities are different to each who beholds them, each evoking a different emotion dependent on time, place and companion. And then this emotion is lost or adapted if at some point and in some way we attempt to explain or describe it.I also interpreted a rise, age of grandeur and fall of the cities described. Poignant to the last.From an educational perspective, Calvino provides insights to globalisation, urbanisation, urban sprawl, materialism and what Doreen Massey would deem a 'Global Sense of Place'.I'm sure I will need to reread this collection again in the future, and will no doubt interpret it differently each time I do.",2017-08-30 02:09:59,3,en,2017-08-30 02:09:59,8,2017,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,185

Duncan Lamb,"Read alongside The Great Course's ""A Day's Read."" This book is a collection of descriptions of cities imagined by Calvino as ones told to Kubla Khan by Marco Polo to entertain him, ostensibly as cities in his vast empire. The descriptions are short and poetic and most reveal some insight into how cities define themselves, or on the character of their people or their culture through whimsical symbolism. Interspersed are short dialogues between Marco Polo and the Emperor that carry the back story along. This classic begs for an illustrated version of different artists drawing what they imagine for each description, many of which would appear like something out of a Dr. Suess book. An internet search shows no such book unfortunately, although many artists have done a few drawings of the descriptions they like most. I've heard that this book is an inspiration and much-loved by civil engineers and architects, and I can see why.

The chapters are short, a page or two mostly, and are divided into different cities that either a modern narrator or Marco Polo describe. Sometimes the description is an abbreviated view of the city, other times it is a small slice of life of the narrator's interactions or observances of the locals.Calvino seems to explain that all the cities are somewhat the same and draw upon the memories of the narrators' past experiences with other cities they have experienced in their travels. Marco Polo is narrating his travel journal to Kublai Khan and periodically Khan will interject questions or comments.I enjoyed ""If on a winter's night a traveler"", but I wasn't able to grasp and enjoy ""Invisible Cities"".

Evie,"This reads like a collection of marvelous lucid dreams. While the imagery is surely enough to inspire artists across all mediums, there's a distressing attitude towards women that I can't shake. Sure, most of it amounts to ""the women here are beautiful, you can watch them bathe, and they will gladly roll you in the hay because they just love foreigners,"" which I can deal with to an extent. One episode, though, in Hypatia, describes how Marco Polo wanted to see women bathing, but found suicide victims instead. He felt ""cheated,"" and so went to the elders to... I don't know, figure out why they were dead? Maybe? But then there are women with firm nipples riding horses and all that, so I guess the suicides don't matter too much after all. At this point I just thought to myself, dude, women are just accessories in your architectural fever dream, and I'm not impressed. Colored the whole work after that point for me.

Christina Tang-Bernas,"The concept of this book seemed kind of esoteric initially and to be fair, it did start off kind of slowly. However, the more I read, the more I became intrigued about what Marco Polo and Kublai Khan were discussing under the guise of describing (made-up) cities and Khan's kingdom. For me, it was like I could see something deeply profound in my peripheral vision, but it was just out of reach. The language is poetic, deceptively simple for startingly deep concepts about people, the cities they create and dwell in and destroy, and the relationships between them. In one sense, the pages are all different aspects of a single city; in another, the pages describe every city that had existed, does exist, will exist in a sort of exploration of the universality of what happens when people gather in groups together. In fact, my husband and I ended up in an hours-long philosophical discussion at Round Table Pizza with this book as the jumping-off point. This book didn't change my world.

Craig Werner,"I'd dipped into Calvino years back, but never quite understood why so many of my very-best-reader-type friends loved him. Guess the time was right because this time around I found Invisible Cities mesmerizing, clearly an ancestor to Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams, which I've returned to regularly.Framed as an extremely untrustworthily narrated set of colloquies between an imaginary Marco Polo and an even more inaginary Kublai Khan, the nine movements of short immersions in a dazzling array of imaginary cities touches on questions of control and freedom, reality and vision, life and death and pretty much everything else you can think of. What holds them together is Calvino's profound distrust of anything resembling a binary, combined with his awareness of the depth of the human predilection for binaries. Cities rise and fall attempting to realize some ideal, only to discover the futility, which isn't as futile as it seems because a new vision and a new city will be along soon.",2019-07-26 07:35:01,5,en,2019-07-26 07:35:01,7,2019,0.00099,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,160

Louis Pilard,"The great thing about Calvino is that he delights in exploring what it means to be a reader and observer. This book, as some reviewers have rightly said, is about consumption, specifically the similarities between tourism and conquest, the endless consumption and space of experience. Part of it is simply delighting in the sheer absurdity and abundance of possibilities of what humans can create and envision. The other part is that eventually, difference and eroticism becomes boring and repetitive. You can envision endless outrageous cities but once you've read 50 or so, you start to become numb to difference, difference becomes repetitive, and what Marco and Kublai realise is that searching for connection and making it endure is ultimately the way to grow. Through mentally exploring the world of human possibility with Marco, Kublai discovers that he didn't need to conquer the world to be complete or integrated, since it was always impossible to reconcile all that difference in the first place.",2020-06-28 19:06:38,4,en,2020-06-28 19:06:38,6,2020,0.00069,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,162

He evokes unbelievable images, ones that no other author has dared or succeed in imagining, much less describe, depicting them in the reader's mind like an impressionist painter, creating in each one a different and unique idea. I've only ever found comparable beauty in the most fascinating poetry, while I've rarely been affected similarly by prose.•he uses long phrases, filled with subordinate sentences built with a peculiar use of punctuation, sometimes even hard to follow and along which I've lost myself, forgetting the meaning of the words as I was enchanted by their architecture.<s>I wrote a more indepth review on the Italian edition, I might get around to translating sometime in the future, no promises.</s>",2020-08-10 18:31:35,5,en,2020-08-10 18:31:35,8,2020,0.00073,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,165
Aaron Jette,"This is a magical book of prose poetry that stretches the mind and enriches the imagination. It is a written as a series of vignettes of cities ostensibly told by Marco Polo to the Kublai Khan to describe to him his empire. Each city is a surreal mirage of memory and fantasy. The cities seem like philosophical parables about language, memory, the imagination and dreams, the past and future, and our relationship with reality. These cities often lead to profound aphorisms about the relationships between signs and symbols and reality. For example, ""signs form a language, but not the one you think you know,"" or ""falsehood is never in words, it is in things."" Some of my favorite passages are in the discussions between the Khan and Marco Polo that are interspersed between the vignettes. Polo says to the Khan, ""If you want to know how much darkness is around you, you must sharpen your eyes, peering at the faint light in the distance."" This book is like a glimmering star in the night sky populating the ever expanding darkness with memories, dreams, and desires.",2020-10-23 20:07:44,5,en,2020-10-23 20:07:44,10,2020,0.00072,0.00012,0.00016,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,185
Harrison Brewer,"It’s rare for a book to be able to construct an enriching and engaging narrative couched within such sensual imagery if there is no plot. Alternating between lucid visions of imaginary urban environments sprinkled with magical realism and folk lore and the disconnected conversations of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, the book asks thousands of questions about where we live, what cities look like and how they move and encounter. Ultimately the book asks how foreign foreignness actually is. Are we different or all facsimiles of each other? Is life pulled from one coloured thread or thousands? Whilst reading, you can mistake the city described as being one you know, have seen or visited, or read in another book. It’s a spellbinding experience of discovery and nostalgia. Truly wicked (in the cool way) piece of text. As an urban planning student it is an obvious read but for anyone who has lived, will live, or wants to live in a city (should be everyone by now), it’s a fresh, creative, and intuitive way of looking at urban life.",2021-04-16 16:27:05,5,en,2021-04-16 16:27:05,4,2021,0.0007,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,178
sewena,"this is my first full read, i think--which makes for a total of 2 reads, with the former reading done in parts during high school. back then i thought this was a beautifully written, mystical and dreamy piece; now i still think it's beautiful, but it's definitely just a very philosophical book haha! i think you can draw a lot of interesting observations on imperialism/colonialism from this text (it is, after all, an italian man's story about the italian marco polo's travel writings for mongolian emperor kublai khan's significantly Asian empire), especially as the beginning cities definitely pull from a vaguely west asian cultural language. but, more importantly that all of that, WHY did calvino give kublai khan and marco polo so much homoerotic tension? fellas, is it gay to act as the eyes and body of the emperor while traversing the lands which he never has nor ever will experience himself, and then spend hours smoked out on his porch/playing chess with him whilst telling him sensuous stories for each city, a la 1001 nights? fellas? anyone?",2021-04-23 13:30:43,0,en,2021-04-23 13:30:43,4,2021,0.00461,0.00012,0.00039,0.00013,0.00037,0.00038,178
Terri,"Invisible Cities is a travelogue of unnamed cities, organized loosely into categories, as told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan.Neither its whimsy nor its structure are to my tastes; this has the feel of a parent telling their child about fantasy lands to slowly ease them to bed, but the descriptions, despite their detail, are shallow. There's no story within them, no hook that makes me wonder. They read like prompts: physical descriptions with which the reader could realize, and honestly -- descriptions that the reader could've imagined themselves. The throughline expressed through Marco Polo allows for (minor) thematic exploration, but again -- it's difficult to convincingly tie together a theme when the majority of the book is just descriptions. His inclusion only made me question the validity of the given descriptions, since his presence reframes them as observations from a biased viewer. These descriptions then aren't just bland overviews of some place far away, but they're the differences upon which an Italian man focused on and decided were exotic.",2021-06-19 05:03:23,2,en,2021-06-19 05:03:23,6,2021,0.00068,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,170
Tess,"I'm so glad I was prompted to re-read this book. It's many years since I first read it and then it set me off on a bit of a Calvino binge and I fear it may have done the same again this time around. The prose is simply beautifully poetic as Polo effectively deconstructs the urban form focussing on key urban characteristics and traits to shape a narrative of imaginary cities all named female. Whether these are all aspects of one city, of Venice, is not clear. Whether they reflect the differing perspectives of Polo and Khan of a shared city, or whether they refer to foreign explorations is not certain. What is clear is how each vignette reflects on how we live in cities and society, how the urban form functions, how we stretch against the limits of our spaces and resources. I'm sure everyone has their favourites, for me it's Dorotea, after which I named my Dorotea cowl knitting pattern, and Leonia which is such a vivid imagining of the consequences of consumptions and how we may be engulfed in the waste we create if we had to actually live with it rather than shipping it elsewhere and thus exporting such consequences; so timely almost 50 years since it was first published.",2021-12-09 16:33:11,5,en,2021-12-09 16:33:11,12,2021,0.00074,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,214

Sangeetha Sankaran,"Aging emperor Kublai Khan rules over an expansive empire but doesn't know much about the marvels it holds. He relies on the accounts of various explorers to understand his peoples and their customs better. One explorer who catches his eye is the young Venetian Marco Polo. The form is so interesting. The story is split into sections which describe different cities. It's told from the perspective of Polo. The bits in italics between the sections reveal more. They describe in the third person the relationship between Khan and Polo. We learn that the two speak different languages and can't actually understand one another. We learn that Polo uses gestures, artifacts, and onomatopoeia to describe a place. The clear descriptions are just for us. It makes you wonder, how much of language is fungible and how much does Khan really understand? As a city dweller, I liked the meditations on what makes a city such and what distinguishes them from one another. Much like how Polo sees Venice reflected in every city, I can't help but compare everywhere to New York.",2022-10-26 07:07:20,4,en,2022-10-26 07:07:20,10,2022,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,180
Matt,"The book is framed in a dreamlike structure where Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan all of his cities in the kingdom that he's conquered. An anthology of city descriptions, usually only taking a page or two, are interspersed with poetic, dreamlike conversations between Khan and Polo, which seem to set the theme or conclude the series of cities. It has many moments of beauty and endless ingenuity, with the caveat that the imagination is limited by cities that Polo is already familiar with, or repeated templates. Most of the patterns went over my head though, as did the relevance of the conversations with Khan and Polo to the following or preceding cities. There many moments of beauty and strong emotional moments though, and lots of meta-philosophical or textual elements, so is worth reading alone to gaze into that. It just gets a bit repetitive after a while, but theme of degradation and imagination were unique and developed a bit over the whole book, but it left me a bit befuddled.",2023-01-01 05:31:34,3,en,2023-01-01 05:31:34,1,2023,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,171
Lukas Van Veen,"The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls.Leonia’s rubbish little by little would invade the world, if, from beyond the final crest of its boundless rubbish heap, the street cleaners of other cities were not pressing, also pushing mountains of refuse in front of themselves. Perhaps the whole world, beyond Leonia’s boundaries, is covered by craters of rubbish, each surrounding a metropolis in constant eruption.“The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.”",2023-01-02 17:49:42,4,en,2023-01-02 17:49:42,1,2023,0.00718,0.00011,0.00039,0.00018,0.00046,0.00029,209
Anusha Datar,"The book explores the travels of Marco Polo as he recounts his adventures to the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan. Each chapter captures a different city, each with its own unique characteristics, stories, and memories. Calvino blends the fantastical with the real, creating a world that feels believable and intangible a the same time, and revealing truths about people, society, and empire within those dialectics. The writing style is also a standout feature of the book. Calvino's prose is elegant and lyrical, and the book feels warm, but not cozy, and descriptive, but not familiar. I really enjoyed the experience of reading this book, even though I can nearly guarantee you I will have trouble recalling most of the names of any of the cities or the exact points of progression in Khan and Polo's conversation, though I'm not sure it ultimately matters.I would definitely recommend this book - I enjoy Calvino's writing overall and find this book really approachable and fast, and it reads more like a work of visual art than it does an argument or story.",2023-01-31 15:58:36,4,en,2023-01-31 15:58:36,1,2023,0.00055,0.00014,0.00019,0.00014,0.00018,0.00016,178
kaitlyn osborn,"“My mind goes on containing a great number of cities I have never seen and will never see, names that bear with them a figure or a fragment or glimmer of an imagined figure: Getullia, Odile, Euphrasia, Margara.” This brilliant work is less a series of short stories &amp; more a catalog of vignettes born from Calvino’s penchant for the imaginative. He describes in evocative imagery “cities I have never seen and will never see.” Dalí-esque descriptions of imaginary cities are interspersed with dreamed-up dialogue in which Marco Polo &amp; Kublai Khan contemplate the philosophical (what constitutes reality) &amp; the personal (the fleeting satisfaction of conquest, creating an empire so vast that one man could never encounter—much less enjoy—it all). Very little narrative structure, but a delightful read for anyone who desires to glimpse the unique perspective of a traveler in distinctly impossible places.Calvino is a master in his own right, but for the uninitiated reader I might introduce this book as  The Busy World of Richard Scarry + Borges + (it begs repeating) Dalí.",2023-02-05 01:47:28,0,en,2023-02-05 01:47:28,2,2023,0.00076,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,176
Swapna Kothari,"It's metaphorical and yet literal in its own rights. It reminds me that much before the Inception feature film, a book took you into a world where the readers' imagination is her/his only limitation and was as important as the author's. Beyond Polo's journey and Khan's attentiveness, the narrative forces you to consider what you imagined up until that dialogue... a place within a city... the living dead... from the stone to the rat, all allegories. Not having ever been to Venice (which many readers and even the book implies to having described), I imagined that each vivid description was painted to give the Khan a taste of what lies within his empire and beyond, and was completely another city or a place within it from anywhere in the world. Sometimes Utopian in nature, if you know what I mean. I also tended to go back to a previous part to just join or dissect places as and when the book progressed and my regressed memories of visited places came fore.",2018-01-17 15:53:54,4,en,2018-01-17 15:53:54,1,2018,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,171
Amelia,"Read for uni - literary criticism and theory module.I had some seriously mixed feelings about this. The language in itself is beautiful, some of the images and metaphors it explores are fascinating and thought-provoking, but it doesn't really fit coherently enough for me to enjoy it as a whole 'novel'? I feel as though I'd appreciate it more if it were just a collection of prose poetry descriptions, but then I suppose it would defeat a lot of the allegorical nature of what Calvino was trying to achieve. I definitely enjoyed discussing it more than reading it, as I think it's one of those books that are alright if you read them, but hold a deeper meaning once you actually analyse them and consider the underlying meanings and metaphors, if that makes sense? So three stars for the pretty language and my appreciation of some of the metaphors, but it isn't something I'd otherwise pick up, and at times I just hated reading it.",2018-02-18 18:59:37,3,en,2018-02-18 18:59:37,2,2018,0.00054,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,164
Hans van der Veeke,"What an interesting book this is. Marco Polo is telling Kublai Kahn about the cities of his empire. But they are all imaginary cities, each have the name of a woman and belonging to one of the eleven themes. It took me some time to realize that each of these cities is a metaphor for things in life. Too late I realized that each of the short essays needs pondering. Best to read one, stare into the distance for some time and let it sink in. It makes more sense that way. And if you do this, they each become a shining little gem.Another thing I can enjoy immensely is the mathematical symmetry between the chapters and the themes and the order in which they appear. I would have never guessed when I wouldn’t have read this Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisib...). And knowing this it makes me appreciate the book even more.

Gordon,"Invisible Cities is another wonderful work of Italo Calvino. Sitting somewhere between poetry and prose, Invisible Cities touches on themse of architecture, urbanism, sociology, religion, the environment, and so many more. The power of Calvino's work comes in his ability to provide a vivid image of an entire city in a few pages of text. Each city feels like a place you have known your whole life, providing you with the chance to project your own ideas of your own home onto these lyrical descriptions.I imagine Italo Calvino and Jorge Louis Borges must have been friends, or at least aware of each others' work. The lyricism and rich narrative which Calvino creates rings so close to the feeling that I get when reading a Borges story.This is a great book for both a quick and slow read. Each city can be read over and over again, or you can pass through without a second glance, not unlike traveling through real cities.

Eilis O sullivan,"This was one of the most bizarre and wonderful books I have ever read. Comparable to Borges stories from 'Fictions', where you can feel as though you really have to concentrate to understand what is going on, 'Invisible Cities' is surprisingly relaxing. There isn't any need to remember every city that is named, but rather to contemplate what they actually mean. As you travel Marco Polo to each one there is something new revealed or examined. The dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo can either be contemplative or funny. It is wonderful to think that just because Marco Polo has described this place doens't mean that it actually exists and you need to be able to read deeper than what is written. The language is beautiful and the fact that it isn't long makes it an enjoyable read. There isn't too much there to overwhelm and the fact that it defies genres makes it even more intriguing.",2019-01-15 21:12:33,5,en,2019-01-15 21:12:33,1,2019,0.00063,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,158

Except I plan to read this over and over again. It may not be for everyone (if you’re easily exasperated with absurdism, for example), but it is art.“If you saw it, standing in its midst, it would be a different city; Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes.

There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return.

Kunal Jain,"To sum up the book in a phrase, invisible cities is an architect’s wet dream. You almost feel every city fading away as you move on with the narrations full of vivid descriptions and details upstaging the previous ones. One can’t help when he leaves a city for a new one waiting for him in an obscure and surreal realm. This book reminds me of Salvador Dali. In fact it is Dali trying to bend architecture and physics on paper! Exotic smells like “odour of elephants and sandalwood ash” dilate your nostrils throughout the book. Calvino loves to celebrate verbs in excess and boy that works like a magical turn on. By the time you tread the last pages of the book, you will forget and loose track of the previous ones forcing you to go back and drink a bit more so you can crave for the carvings again.

Efi Karafotia,"I usually give at least 2 stars if I manage to at least finish a boring book, and this is the case here. Maybe I was unable to see the beauty of it: I was surprised to notice that every chapter is a small description of a different imaginary city -and they are countless. The cities (although pictured very shortly) are always grand and majestic, but very superficially described, since their people are seldom mentioned. Maybe a city’s appearance is what matters most after all. The descriptions are repetitive, and many cities share features - I don’t even know if this was on purpose or because of dried-up imagination.Not liking this book made me feel like I was missing out on something great I was unable to interpret. You definitely expect that Calvino is building up to something. Not the case here. The lack of plot makes it an easy speed read (boredom aside).

Ryan Swen,"Invoked Hong’s “infinite worlds possible” maxim when raving about this magnificent book, and the comparison isn’t entirely inapposite: there is a certain quality that Calvino evokes here, founded upon the notion that each of this cities could all be real or all be false, all projections of Marco Polo’s native Venice or Kublai Khan’s fantasies about his empire or some combination or non-combination of the two, and it’s entirely to his credit that nothing is resolved. Like the men at its center, there is neither resolution nor total denial, instead a complete state of odd, often beautiful contentment and continual discovery. Invisible Cities‘s final exhortation is as close to a definitive, concrete statement as the book comes, yet it explicitly prescribes searching — a continual, never totally completable task — as the solution, which Calvino does with endless variation and complexity, while laying out his ideas for all to see.",2019-06-11 08:40:03,5,en,2019-06-11 08:40:03,6,2019,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,150
Vincent Ribeiro,"I always come back to this book when I am feeling curious about the world, unsure of ""what it all means"". Invisible Cities tells the story of Marco Polo's accounts on his travels in dialogue with the emperor, Kublai Khan...taking itself literally as fantasy, it puts the reader in a place to consider what travel means. If travel needs to happen. And perfects the relationship of writer and reader, through the use of the character's relationship in Calvino's literature. It brings to mind Alain de Botton's the art of travel,“What we find exotic abroad may be what we hunger for in vain at home.”Beautifully written, as always, Calvino makes us question with wonder and curiosity the world we live in and our relationship with time, place and meaning around us. “You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.”",2019-12-12 00:09:41,5,en,2019-12-12 00:09:41,12,2019,0.00067,0.00012,0.00016,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,152
Hakim,"Italo Calvino never ceases to amaze me with an out-of-nowhere way of storytelling. In ""Invisible Cities,"" There is no such thing as a plot. Marco Polo told narratives and Kublai Khan heard and sometimes interrupted him. Marco Polo described several cities to Kublai Khan before finally admitting, ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice."" As he travels across the continent, he found the new interpretation of his dear hometown. A new city that he would reach makes a new understanding of Venice. Venice where the streets and canals entangled firmly. Venice where the daily life of the living is dictated by the dead. Venice where the construction never ends so the destruction doesn't come. When provoked by Khan about the pointless journey that he had done for his life, he argued that in his expedition he found the past that he didn't know he had:“ By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present.

Akshay,"It took me some time to warm up to the format and the meandering nature of the vignettes or it could just be that the first few did not really do too much for me. But I eventually lost my way in the cities and found it hard to surface for air constantly. There are some truly bewitching creations here that are thought provoking parables about death, culture and people in general. Of course, it also causes one to question the roles of literal cities and their function both today and over the ages as repositories of knowledge, stories and ways of life. The dialogue between Kublai and Marco Polo lends its own air of existentialism and gravity. Some of their talks verge on chit-chat while others hint at the type of world the two of them lived in at the time (along with cheeky callbacks to age old cities and cities that are yet to even exist).

Harvard,"the thing I love about this book is that it's a fundamentally different experience depending on how you read it. You can either read it in one entire go, trying to comprehend the various connections and intersections between the parables, or you can read it in fragments, flipping to random pages, taking on one a day, or one a week, or one a month. Each method will give some meaning, some beauty, some better way of understanding the complex, intricate, random, unintuitive and inevitable nature of a city, an empire. the thing I hate about this book is that it panders to a straight male audience to a point that I, as a straight male, am still distracted by all this pandering. (I admit the frame narrative is a locker room conversation between Marco Polo talking to Kubla Khan, but still).

Richard Thompson,"I enjoy novels that masquerade as other forms of writing. Novels can be written as diaries, histories, dictionaries, travelogues or geographies. Here we have a novel in the form of a catalog of cities presented to Kublai Khan by the inveterate liar, adventurer and storyteller, Marco Polo. The cities are presented as psychological and moral metaphors that reflect their people and the state of the empire. Whatever truth lies in the descriptions is not literal. Conversations between Polo and the Khan bridge the descriptions, but they are never developed as characters and there is next to nothing in the way of plot or forward movement of themes. This book was an interesting writing experiment and had moments that I enjoyed, but I'm glad that my introduction to Calvino was through the wonderful Cloven Viscount, rather than this book, so that I'm still eager to keep reading his books.",2021-04-12 08:40:03,3,en,2021-04-12 08:40:03,4,2021,0.00066,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,148
Jessica,"""Having said this, I do not wish your eyes to catch a distorted image, so I must draw your attention to an intrinsic quality of this unjust city germinating secretly inside the secret just city: and this is the possible awakening—as if in an excited opening of windows—of a later love for justice, not yet subjected to rules, capable of reassembling a city still more just than it was before it became the vessel of injustice. But if you peer deeper into this new germ of justice you can discern a tiny spot that is spreading like the mounting tendency to impose what is just through what is unjust, and perhaps this is the germ of an immense metropolis. . . . From my words you will have reached the conclusion that the real Berenice is a temporal succession of different cities, alternately just and unjust.

Calum,"'Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice'While some of the cities described by Calvino are less interesting than others, this book is so much more than the sum of its parts. Haunted by a kind of end of history, in which Kublai Khan tries to make sense of his empire before it crumbles, a task that becomes increasingly impossible as Marco Polo presents him with infinite places that come to stretch beyond the grasp of both geography and chronology. Every city is both unknowable, an everything that is too large to understand, and simultaneously it is only what was known all along - every city is Venice, is San Fransisco. There's so much to make sense of in the world - something that Calvino seems to see as simultaneously sad and beautiful - but, in the end, we can only really make sense of it in relation to the things we already know. The last paragraph is incredible. Calvino good.",2022-01-03 05:46:57,5,en,2022-01-03 05:46:57,1,2022,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,165
Vera,"This is a novel, a work of fiction, but one without any storyline. Each chapter describes a city, fantastical and beguiling, cities that don’t belong on a map. Each is really short, roughly 1-2 pages.At some point, you realise that Calvino is not talking about cities at all, not in the way we normally think of them. They are constructed based on ideas and dreams, thought experiments about how we should live with ourselves, with one another.It took me a while to get into the rhythm of his writing but once lulled, I felt like I was in a dream. There is something rhythmic to the writing, to the repetitive way the cities are presented to you, like vignettes in those kid toys that you look hold up to the light and click through the images.While Invisible cities is a short book, it still demands to be sipped and savoured.

Miguel,"Invisible Cities is not only a wonderful exercise of imagination but most importantly a great study of cities as the result of events, processes, and people. Although present throughout the book, it is neither the architecture nor the urbanism of the cities that are important at the time of understanding the meaning of what Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan. It is, in fact, life, the act of living, the ways of seeing, living, and hearing that construct, instant by instant and meaning by meaning, the complex urbanity of this imaginations.  This is achieved through the constant reminder of time in its past, present, and future forms, as a self-transforming entity in which all instants come together to be affected by each other. Temporality is king. This becomes very clear when Marco Polo describes the cities of Zaira, Zoe, and Clarice, where this 'thick' or 'intense' understanding of time takes the form of the 'city-as-event' in regard to Zaira, 'city-as-landscape' (landscape understood as an ecological territory) in regard to Zoe, and 'city-as-matter' in the case of Clarice.  Consequently, Italo Calvino succeeds at not only taking us to whimsical semiotic landscapes, but also providing architects, urbanists, and geographers with a very useful and stimulating precedent for urban exploration. Amazing read.",2022-07-13 16:52:52,5,en,2022-07-13 16:52:52,7,2022,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,210

Shhhhh Ahhhhh,"This book is confusing, in the way that most complex ideas are before you've teased meaning out of them. In the beginning, it was easy enough to see the familiar ideas. The ideas of multiplicity, possibility, synchronicity, and the comments on the combinatorics of social life and its artifacts (physical structures). However, as the book progressed, the arguments became more complex. There was not only the interrogation of what constituted a city but, with the story between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, the interrogation of existence, dialogue, description, the adequacy of language in describing observation, the utility of experiencing that which can be predicted to exist deriving from our ordinary life, and deeper questions about the rules and meaning underlying it all.

Iris Shao,"Wonderful postmodern writing that allowed imagination and introspection.

""Arriving at each new city, the traveller finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.” Lots of times, desires stem from memories and past and humans hang onto the dead branches.

C,"Marco Polo is in conversation with Kublai Khan, while interspersing chapters are short snipets about those imaginative cities that they are discussing. The conversations book end a few cities in each chapter and Kublai Khan subtly mentions something the cities might be about: like playing a game of chess, seeing the board from above, and then seeing the cities in that chapter from above. Calvino is extremely imaginative here, coming up with a new idea for a city every couple of pages. Each city could have been an entire book, but Calvino is precise with his words. His powers of imagination are amazing. To have a new city be perfectly described within a couple of pages so you can see it in your mind is quite a feat. The ideas are always stunning.

Felicia,"Sometimes it seems like each paragraph is in itself is a story that ends on a cliffhanger, and the next paragraph has a reveal that makes you backtrack to the preceding paragraph just to make sure it is what you think it is (sometimes it is, something it’s more).

Roger Mexico,"An ingenious concept, beautifully realized. The worlds and cities all seem so distinct but are all interconnected (in many ways). They are all one. The writing is a nice mix of abstract philosophizing and clever, almost universally accessible little details (sights, sounds, etc. that we encounter in our daily lives, no matter where we are). It reminds me a lot of the pseudo-historical, mini-biographies in Borges’ “A Universal History of Infamy”. Both authors are able to render worlds (through cities and lives) in a few pages. Exciting and inspiring. I’m really tempted to include the final exchange between the Khan and Marco Polo here (it’s a beautiful way of thinking about the world) but I think it would be better for anyone curious to take the journey through Calvino’s cities.

Their secrets, their desires, their fears.

Ben,"A book that's hard to describe in a way that captures the ideas it contains: fitting, given that the core theme of the collected pieces is the limitation of words and the spaces between symbols.There is very little linking each page that describes a different city except their elusiveness. What's brilliant, then, about the collection of vignettes is that they individually and collectively can spark all sorts of ideas, revelations, reflections. There's a lot of ideas that could be explored in standard philosophical essays: what is the nature of a place, empire, language? But Calivno's writing casts these questions as shadows of his descriptions, and in doing so provokes much more introspection than a more straightforward essay would.Not a book for people who enjoy a good plot, but definitely worth exploring even if it's just for the beautiful scenes contained within.",2020-01-08 22:18:37,4,en,2020-01-08 22:18:37,1,2020,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,141

Henry Lopez,"""Invisible Cities"", is purported to be Marco Polo's impressions and descriptions of the various towns, cities, and places he explored while sering Kublai Khan. I found it to be an organizational mess. The version I own of ""Invisible Cities"", is a convoluted mess, without a framing narrative to give context and structure to the various entries. The time period the entries are written in snaps back and forth, from the 13th Century, when Polo traveled through the lands of the Mongolian Empire, to the present, yet no explanation is given for this. I gave this book an additional star for the individual entries, many of which were well-written and lyrical, evoking the exotic locales Polo saw and experienced.

George Siehl,"An imaginative and insightful work of literature that has been lovingly treated by its translator.It imagines dialogues between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo as the Emperor inquires of the cities the merchant has visited in his wide travels. The city descriptions are brief, no more then three pages, fanciful, and filled with nuance. Each stands as a fable touching on such subjects as language, communication, good, evil, and the intricate relationship between people and the urban complex in which they live. The question arises as to which is the shaping element, citizen or city. While the tales that unfold are sometimes overly intricate, they are always interesting.

Christina,"A truly wonderful, rich and fulfilling narrative of foreign, imagined (or real) cities. I took a ton of notes, as some of the descriptions of those wonderous places are poetic, surreal and something I could not have come up myself with. Cities hanging on threats, burried upside down beneath the earth, older than mankind and in close connection with the cosmic universe. But behold: this is not only a highly phantastic, surreal travel story, but also deeply philosophical in nature. It touches deep thoughts about why we travel, why we feel at home in different spaces, how cities and their inhabitants work on a ethical, psychological or social level... and how utopia really could look like (or feel). What makes a city a city? What is the difference between the outside and the inside? How does a city change over time?These stories encounter an intense topological/spatial discussion in the form of surreal poetry.

Christine,"I kept coming across the author Italo Calvino (strong name!) yet knew nothing at all about his style. My first impression upon beginning Invisible Cities was “oh no! What did I just commit myself to?” Every so often I begin a book and just never fully “get” it. Thankfully, that was not the case here. I just needed some time to warm up to it…hence why it took me two months to pick back up and finish.Invisible Cities is witty, imaginative, and really unlike anything I have read before. It also reminded me so much of the joys of traveling and discovering new places — something I have deeply missed since COVID arrived. Except the cities mentioned throughout the book are more like places I would find in my dreams rather than the real world.

Abby,"i had a whole review prepared for this in my head and then immediately fell asleep... so here's a quick recap of my thoughts.The writing was descriptive and magical and truly made the cities come to life. They were built up in such exquisite and towering ways, and yet all the stories were fragmented. You only get to see little snippets of the cities, almost like no one can ever truly know a city, or maybe the city never existed at all. This book takes place at both single moments in time and centuries of it. There are moments when you begin to think that you can pinpoint something, whether it be a time or a place, but in the next moment, you're somewhere new.This book feels like it takes place in limbo. Nothing seems exact. Nothing appears as it is. Both nothing and everything happens. The cities exist and they don't. The characters exist and they don't.",2022-01-10 12:46:30,4,en,2022-01-10 12:46:30,1,2022,0.00081,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,158
Gabriel,Invisible Cities is a book written in allegory. Each city Marco Polo describes to Kublai Khan is a metaphor. These metaphorical cities serve as vehicles to explain and commentate on the nature of things. These things are abstract and not often verbalized or even noticed in the life of people. Each city is a meditation on the abstractions and behaviors of human existence.After a string of short recollections in which Marco is describing his imagined cities there is dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan which serves to further reveal the meaning behind the book. The final pages is the last of the dialogue between the two in which everything in the book is made to make the most sense.With the book being written in allegory it is only right to wish to read it many times over and see what else you can find in Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities.,2022-04-26 03:00:19,5,en,2022-04-26 03:00:19,4,2022,0.00078,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,150
V,"I don't know exactly what this was, but I am somewhat positively disposed. The fanciful and almost poetical description of the imaginary cities was pleasant, although the cities were so numerous it became somewhat tiresome. Maybe one is supposed to read about one city at a time and ruminate on it for a while.I think I'll have to read it more carefully to get a better idea what's up with this work. I don't kid myself that I'll have a good understanding of Calvino's intent but maybe I'll get a few more of the points he's trying to make. Fortunately, this book is short enough that it would not be too much of an encumbrance.I bet there's an artist out there--probably a painter--who has created a series of works that give a visual representation of all of these cities.

Antti Värtö,"This was such a fun book: it felt like I was reading tongue-in-cheek worldbuilding exercises, and at the same time I felt like I was reading prose poetry. That's a pretty unique combination. In the book, ""Marco Polo"" is telling tales of distant cities to ""Kublai Khan"". I'm using the quote marks, because these characters are only distantly linked to real people with the same names. Polo tells of different fantastical cities, some of which could be real places, but most couldn't. There are cities for the dead, city made entirely of plumbing, a double city where the other half is administrative and the other is made of amusement parks, and so on.Most of the stories feel metaphorical, but it's hard to say what they are metaphors of. I think I may need to re-read the book in order to grasp it better.

Georgia Papakirk,"This book made me upset. I liked the part where Khan probes Polo about Venice, but I generally don’t understand the book, it’s contents, and this concept. It may be the translation is bad, and I will never truly get to read this book in the manner in which is was supposed to be read. Also, all of the people that rated this book above a 3 can personally call me so we can fight. Just because it has poetry does not mean that it is good poetry or sensical. You shouldn’t have to “get” books for them to make sense. At that point, your writing is exclusionary and elitist if you are having the reader constantly trying to understand what they are reading.

Pembroke,"Cities described like lovers, with impressions residing in how we feel when they leave us, or when we leave them. Polo, Khan, you, &amp; I know that they, (we), never really do, and that these aren't really cities being discussed. A hallowed testimony of the ability of an organic thought-metropolis (glittering or septic, and all in between) to exalt, elate, enthrall, and more importantly, scorn, sneer, spurn. An urban blueprint for the manifestation of human nature (w/e that is) in all its facets and estuaries, with the expected conclusion that they all lead to the same embouchure, the same lover, the same city- varying placements of the mouth aside.Propose a desire and make it real; Calvino materializes the immaterial.",2017-06-20 05:08:08,5,en,2017-06-20 05:08:08,6,2017,0.00073,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,119
John,"Calvino and Borges both excite me with the promise of their ingenuity. However--after reading this short read (about one bus ride for me), I felt I didn't take much away from it. I found the Dialogue between Kubla Kahn and Marco Polo to be the best bit--and while the city descriptions had great lyricism, it started to rub a bit thin with me--even for a book that's only 160 pages. It's poetic, but not my cup of tea, and it never coalesces really into anything worth remembering, in my opinion. For a book I was anticipating savoring, I wasn't engaged enough to dig deeper. Thus continues the lesson of reading the books at the right time. Same thing happened to me with ""To the Lighthouse"", which I enjoyed but probably would have appreciated more so, if i read it later in life.",2017-08-30 22:40:02,3,en,2017-08-30 22:40:02,8,2017,0.00056,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,142
Karen,"Published in Italian in 1972, this is a beautiful little gem of a book which imagines conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Marco Polo describes a series of cities, each having a woman’s name; they are all different and are grouped into eleven categories. However, is he really only describing one city? It’s difficult to describe or categorise the book; it’s philosophical and poetic and it will speak to different readers in different ways. For me it spoke about the power of imagination and how our responses to and feelings about cities and places are shaped by our experiences, memories, hopes, expectations and desires. Although written in 1972, I found some of the descriptions quite prophetic about what is happening today to our cities and society in general.",2018-01-05 00:18:52,4,en,2018-01-05 00:18:52,1,2018,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,129
Sandhya,"I've just reread this for the first time in about 30 years, and at the outset I was unhappy--the book was not living up to my grandiose memory of it. It felt somehow less fresh and arresting, and also thematically thinner than I remembered. As I went along, I found the various meditations on imagined ""cities"" getting sharper and more poignant, and the dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan also grew more pointed. By the end, I was happy to have spent the time revisiting this classic.

Jaz,"The explorer Marco Polo describes the many cities he’s visited on his travels to Kublai Khan. The cities are all one yet different. I loved the dreamy style of this, the prose that was so eloquent like poetry and flowed beautifully. At times I wondered what era it was set in because some of the cities were magical, others historical and others very modern. The descriptions and imagery were vivid; and the various ways the differences in places, from their landmarks to objects to people, were able to evoke different emotions and memories was thought provoking. I knocked off a star because the ending was a bit abrupt? It didn’t flow as much as I liked between each chapter, and overall the end didn’t tie everything together which was a bit disappointing.",2018-12-30 22:17:26,4,en,2018-12-30 22:17:26,12,2018,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,132
Miranda Grey,"Having read the first few tales I had already determined to give the book a poor rating because I was bored immensely. It was, however, because I had not yet understood. As I kept on reading, I was overcome with awe and amazement at the literary genius. Each tale reads like a poem and this is a quality that the writer himself acknowledged and arranged the stories into fitting categories with titles that set the mood.The stories are short and unforgettable, laced with dialogue similar to that of sultan and Sheherazade. It is simply a wonderful collection of tales that enlightens the soul.

Tech Nossomy,"Magic-realism and barely historically accurate, an account of cities whose differences are shaped by the people that live in it and their cultures and hence there is no actual connection between the message of the story and Marco Polo or Kublai Khan. Anybody else who has visited cities in other countries, and most of us have, will have similar experiences of cultural variety and marvel. Therefore the premise of the identity of the two protagonists (no one else features in the book) to relay these stories is far fetched. For some reason the table of contents counts down.The nature of the writing is kaleidoscopic, which is rich in detail, to the point of grandeur, but ultimately meaningless.",2019-04-28 05:09:30,2,en,2019-04-28 05:09:30,4,2019,0.00061,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,117
Maureen,"If you're looking for a mind-bending read, try Calvino's experimental historical fiction in which Marco Polo describes 55 cities to Kulai Khan. The book invites you to read it from cover to cover. But other structures in the book invite other sequences in which to read about the cities, as well as the relationship between Polo and Khan, to pull more subtle meaning from the text. The cities are partly real, partly fantasy -- just as Khan's concern about what will happen to his empire as it sits on the edge of decline is real and Polo and Khan's imaginations about what a city can be is a fantasy inspired by the opium in the amber pipe they periodically share. Ultimately, the writing is about perspective. I think. But, what do I know?

These are the unverified and undocumented conversations that Marco Polo and the great Khan had. Even though he was getting older, Khan was a very intelligent man.

Phillip Wang,"In Invisible Cities, Calvino tells the story of 55 cities in the day of Kublai Khan, not by the buildings and the layouts of the cities, but by the underlying desires and feelings of the cities. Sometimes this shows up in the people of the city, for example, the city where everyone looks like someone you know who has died. Or it shows up in the structure of the city, like the city made out of spider-webs, suspended between two mountains. The prose of the cities is very imaginative, and paints very elaborate scenes. I appreciate Invisible Cities for its creativity and a different way to think about cities, but found it pretty hard to get through.

I read it in a linear way over the span of a few days - but it feels much more like a collection of poems; than interconnected feelings you have to ""read in order"". Maybe I missed something?

Calvino is practically a visionary with his ability to foresee the future of human kind with his descriptions of the cities and the feelings of humans within (I very much love the city with the populating people, it was like a more pretty image of 'Make Room, Make Room'!).Do read this book and judge for yourself.

Dallas Fawson,"Invisible Cities is a book that was difficult for me to come up with a rating for. It falls into the category of books that I did not love, but through no fault of the book itself or the author. Invisible Cities is beautifully written and infinitely imaginative, but in ways that did not always connect with me as a reader.I find the frequent comparisons between the fiction of Borges and Calvino to be baffling in some ways. While they both write about history, memory and dreams, their approaches could not be more different. Where Borges's prose is straightforward and largely unadorned, Invisible Cities almost reads more like a series of poems in prose than a novel. Borges makes almost constant references to mostly real (but sometimes imaginary) historians, philosophers, literary figures, etc., but the connections to history in Invisible Cities are almost always oblique. Though the frame from which the story is told involves Marco Polo describing to Kublai Khan the cities he has visited on his travels (or maybe not), this novel is in no way character driven. The vast majority of it is describing bizarre and often impossible cities. I found some of the sequences to be beautiful and breathtaking (a vanished city where only the piping of the buildings remains, a city where those who enter swap memories with other inhabitants, etc.), but despite its short length I was ready to be done with it when I reached the end. Again, this says more about me as a reader than Invisible Cities as a book. Poems in prose alienate me pretty quickly as a reader, but if you enjoy dream-like meditations on memory and imagination, this might be right up your alley.

That in itself has a lot to say about how I feel towards this book. The book is a loosely structured dialog between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, both, respectively, a traveler/explorer and an emperor; alongside descriptions of 55 cities. The descriptions of cities are quite surreal and in a sense are very philosophical and has symbolism than meets the eye, at least from my point of view.

I couldn't resist such a charm.Even though I don't fully understand it, listening to the conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, letting go of my anguish, I breathe a long breath with the moment's tension lingering, and its inspiration.Rather than a novel for cities, it is the perception of places as settlement environment. And it is sophisticatedly visional but at times more accurate and realistic than any other book by urban planners or architects.

Jennings,"I really enjoyed this. Did I fully ‘get’ it? Certainly not, but I will be returning to it again and turning over these stories in my mind. Calvino made my heart ache, missing the feeling of travel abroad, of the things we learn about ourselves and our past when we see something new. I was captivated by the focus on the inner workings of these ‘cities of ideas’. Cities that sustained themselves with new citizens living out the same stories as those before them, cities tied in knots by their interpersonal relationships, cities where the living and the dead blended together…it goes on, endlessly as all forms are ultimately possible. “And I hear, from your voice, the invisible reasons which make cities live, through which perhaps, once dead, they will come to life again”",2021-10-16 10:22:19,5,en,2021-10-16 10:22:19,10,2021,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,134
Andy Davis,"I didn't really know how to rate this. It clearly has some merits but isn't really my cup of tea and I almost gave up despite its brevity. The frame is Marco Polo explaining different fantasy cities to Kubla Khan. The cultures of these cities reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, modern humanity: consumer buy it / bin it culture; building for the sake of it; increasing population and it's impact on traditional life. There are interesting images like a mummy city created under one of the cities. Maybe I would have got more from it if I had concentrated more. Maybe I will dip back in. Really I finished a little disappointed and tired with this canter through so many piecemeal vignettes with insufficient physical description of the citied.

Karl Kraus,"This fascinating little novel can be read in a number of ways. It's the Tales of the 1001 Nights without the death threat. It's a kaleidoscopic account of the vanities and foibles of human societies. It's a critique of modern urban planning in its unashamed anachronisms. It's an exercise in playing games with the reader (hint: almost all of the section titles are arbitrary and interchangeable). It might also be the billionth exercise in straight men's nonsense twaddle about the nature of woman -- note how (almost?) all of the imaginary cities bear women's names -- but I think I'll ignore this for the nonce.

Klaus Neyer,"In this book, Calvino presents short descriptions of 55 cities as related by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, interspersed between fragments of conversation between the two men. Invisible cities is not a novel so much as it is a philosophical exercise; with his depiction of each city, Calvino investigates questions of temporality, geography, and human interaction, while the dialogues between Polo and Kublai deal with the concepts of communication and memory. A motivated reader may seek to identify and interpret the patterns Calvino has embedded in the novel's structure and the similarities between the cities described.

I have seen so many people comment that this is one of the best books they have ever read, but I don't think I understood it at all. Invisible Cities is essentially a collection of short stories/descriptions of the different cities that Marco Polo, the narrator, has visited. Throughout the book he tells the great Khan about the world, but in reality he's only referring to Venice. There is really rich subtext regarding subculture and there was alot to unpack with Khans evolving view of China and the concept of ones ""world"".

So, when I saw this book and one of his others in the local bookshop I had my partner put them behind his back and I chose one at random. It did have a certain similarity to Borges, and more than anything - it was magical! The book is just a collection of descriptions of made-up cities, interspersed with a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo.

My advice is to just let yourself be swept up in the vivid worlds, and let the text say to you what it will.

""What else do you believe I have been talking to you about?""The emperor did not turn a hair. ""And yet I have never heard you mention that name.""And Polo said: ""Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.""",2020-07-01 01:32:54,3,en,2020-07-01 01:32:54,7,2020,0.00097,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,101
Izzy Miller,"I loved the beautiful lyrical descriptions that stretched your imagination further as the book progressed. It gave a feeling of the romantic wonder of exploration and tourism. Poetic prose rather than a novel.I found the book overall hard to navigate though, I feel like I missed bigger meanings or references. While I enjoyed the descriptions I was searching for more somewhere and so ended frustrated. Not much happens, and it feels like ideas are explored, but somehow not properly. I struggled to stay interested. Perhaps I should have read it more like a meditation and the search for some narrative line or theme to guide the voices wouldn’t have distracted.",2020-07-24 22:30:34,3,en,2020-07-24 22:30:34,7,2020,0.00054,0.00014,0.00019,0.00014,0.00018,0.00015,110
Brandur,"The book's premise is _very_ good: each chapter is a single page description of a wondrous city as described by Marco Polo in the court of Kublai Khan. Sections are interspersed with dialog between Polo and the Khan. I had a hard time rating this one because while the prose is wonderful, the writing suggests a profundity of hidden depth (in the themes of the cities of each section, or the relationship between the different ""categories"" of city), but it's not clear whether that depth actually exists. It's either a 3 or 4 star book, and worth reading not only because it's good, but also because it's short and to the point.",2020-08-14 09:39:19,4,en,2020-08-14 09:39:19,8,2020,0.00058,0.00013,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,112
Al,"I think I first came across Italo Calvino through Teju Cole. I don't remember the piece or the context, but the name got lodged in my mind somehow. Sometime last year, someone mentioned the name after reading something I'd written and it sounded so familiar. I realised it was the same person I read from Teju Cole, and I decided to finally -- after many years -- read Invisible Cities. I think the writing style and the cities became repetitive after a while -- and it pains me to say that -- because otherwise, this is an excellent book and the writing is something that's now lodged in my brain and will come back repeatedly and make appearances in my own writing.",2020-09-05 16:39:04,4,en,2020-09-05 16:39:04,9,2020,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,122
Nick Dablin,"What an indescribable book! Halfway between poetry and prose, it's a thoughtful, careful meditation on the nature of cities, and by extension, the human condition. It's a short book, but it's not one you'll want to rush through in a sitting. It's beautiful passages are best savoured, like a box of exquisite chocolates. Each city described is a new facet of thought, and it rewards careful, deliberate reading. At turns surreal, bizarre, anachronistic, horrifying, funny and breathtaking, with a throughline that defies anything as prosaic as a narrative, but is nonetheless compelling.

L (bardcore_viking),"A playful hypothetical conversation between the Khan and Marco Polo about the nature of the world, its people, and the viewpoint of a traveler in foreign lands. The language used to describe each city transports you to being in unrecognizable places with fantastical sounding names and curious habits of the people who live there. Calvino creates beautiful work in each of his books, but this one is one that I can take on a plane or a short trip and feel like my adventures mimic Polo's in a new sort of way.

The previous book I read (Eugene Onegin) is a novel in prose. 200 pages of disciplined poetry following the same rhythm for every stanza including the acknowledgements! After being buried in that, I could only think in a sing-song fashion. That made this book an awkward and stumbling experience where my brain tried to fit different words that rhymed rather than read the actual word written. Given the very different way this book is constructed, with each city just about 2 pages long, it was hard for me to follow this rhythm and enjoy it.

As a scientist, you're almost a by default a stickler for structuralist elements (peaking in the Oulipo movement) so it was easily enjoyable for me.

Even though it's a short book, don't plan on reading it all at once. Read a few sections then set it aside as you decipher its meaning and intricacies before moving on to the next piece.

Unsurprising considering the times in which he lived, love a good collapse of meaning at the turn of the century.

It was kind of confusing, but I think I’m not the proper audience for it, as I struggled with this book’s stylization.

Allyson,"I have to say that I am very partial to this particular work by Calvino. It has a lot to do with the idea of the imaginary city, which is what ""Venice"" becomes in the tales of Marco Polo. However, it also has much to do with the imagistic quality of the writing, that is sometimes rather like Escher in its depiction of the cities. The cities become places both Utopic and Heterotopic at the same time, and many of them are rendered feminine.

Occasionally the author describes cities with trains and modern plumbing, electricity, and taking airplanes from city to city. He also includes LA and New York in the cities he describes.

Ari,"One of my favorite Calvino books. You can read other reviews here to see the 'aboutness' (on the surface it is a series of descriptions of cities either within Kublai Kahn's empire or maybe all descriptions of Venice or maybe all imaginary or...), but the greatness of the book comes from the parallel but slightly off descriptions, the as above so below descriptions, the essence of the city, of EVERY city, and of humanity and civilizations that's included. The nubering system matters, too, so pay attention. Beautiful and fanciful and true to a level that is beyond facts.

I highly recommend this short novel to the ever-exploring, ever-curious traveler, or anyone with a case of wanderlust.",2018-11-18 05:05:00,4,en,2018-11-18 05:05:00,11,2018,0.0007,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00019,0.00015,78
Felix,"It took a second reading for me to really appreciate this book. The first time that I read it, I found it disorientating and confusing. The 'plot', inasmuch as there is one, is largely without clear direction. The book moves from description to description, telling stories of a large number of cities, with only a loose frame connecting each description.So what is this novel about? It's about memory, and about place. It's a story about how those two are connected, and how they construct each other, and about how tension might arise between them. The cities in this novel are only nonexistent because they don't exist. Instead, they tell a story about the story-teller. Each of these places exists within Marco Polo, as a reflection of him, and as a reflection of the places that he has been. To visit any of these cities - were that possible - would be to visit a different city to the one described. The cities are the sum of experiences.In some of the cities, this disconnection from reality is made totally explicit. For example, this is taken from the city of Adelma:I thought: “You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.”In this city, Marco Polo encounters all manner of people who appear to be from his past. Of course, this is not the experience which most people would have in this city - they would not recognise the same people. And yet, in this city there is something universal. The feeling of nearly recognising people is one we can all relate to. In Invisible Cities, it is the central trait of Adelma. So, in a sense, we have all been to Adelma.A number of the cities concern the idea of constant flux, in an almost Heraclitan sense. What I mean by this is that they often consider how one can never really visit the same place twice. Our sense of place is inextricably tied to individual experience. So many of the cities are torn down and rebuilt in various ways, analgous to visiting it years later and having wholly different experiences. For example, this is from the city of Sophronia, a city which is partially deconstructed every year:And so every year the day comes when the workmen remove the marble pediments, lower the stone walls, the cement pylons, take down the Ministry, the monument, the docks, the petroleum refinery, the hospital, load them on trailers, to follow from stand to stand their annual itinerary. Here remains the half-Sophronia of the shooting-galleries and the carousels, the shout suspended from the cart of the headlong roller coaster, and it begins to count the months, the days it must wait before the caravan returns and a complete life can begin again.Here, we see a city which is recurringly incomplete. One part of its essential form is taken away every year, and the citizens must wait to have their whole city back again. One might visit two totally different cities, depending whether or not the caravan is present. This idea of a place built around a festival or some other event is something I found quite relatable, particularly considering that I grew up in a very touristic area. Half of our population really did leave from October to May.To look at an opposite extreme to this, I can cite the city of Trude. This city is perhaps the most relatable one in the whole book. It's also one of the shortest, so I've included its description in full:IF ON ARRIVING at Trude I had not read the city’s name written in big letters, I would have thought I was landing at the same airport from which I had taken off. The suburbs they drove me through were no different from the others, with the same little greenish and yellowish houses. Following the same signs we swung around the same flower beds in the same squares. The downtown streets displayed goods, packages, signs that had not changed at all. This was the first time I had come to Trude, but I already knew the hotel where I happened to be lodged; I had already heard and spoken my dialogues with the buyers and sellers of hardware; I had ended other days identically, looking through the same goblets at the same swaying navels.Why come to Trude? I asked myself. And I already wanted to leave.“You can resume your flight whenever you like,” they said to me, “but you will arrive at another Trude, absolutely the same, detail by detail. The world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end. Only the name of the airport changes.”I've definitely been to Trude. And I've been to Trude in some pretty cool places as well. I've been to Trude in Manilla, and in Tokyo and in Kuala Lumpur. These cities are all awesome in their own ways, I'm sure, but I never saw more of these cities than the inside of an airport, and perhaps a chain restaurant or two. For me, they're all Trude - that's the story of my experience. Until I return to these places and go looking for a city that isn't Trude, they will always be that city in my memory.Almost all of the cities in this book put forward another relatable experience. Those to which I struggle to relate create a sense of wonder. These are ostensibly descriptions of places, but they're more than that: they're descriptions of experiences, using the medium of place.",2019-02-03 17:56:57,5,en,2019-02-03 17:56:57,2,2019,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,954
Chris,"The metaphysical, trancendental discussions between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Reads like poetry. As was intended, of course, by Calvino - an enigmatic, post-modern Writer, whose hand weaves a tale as boggling as an Escher painting. I cannot say I adore it as much as others do. Perhaps it required more time, to relish the tales. Some of it is a bit superfluous, a bit pretentious.

John,"As always with Calvino, a strange and different book. Not at all what I had anticipated. Poetry in prose. That is, it is prose in form, but nearly like poetry in that the words themselves, and the feelings, are my impression. No plot. No charachters really. Entirely surreal. Cities imagined as if by Picasso and Escher. A slim volume. Didn't take long to read. I was astonished to find a city almost like Los Angeles, a city without form or location.

Mariano,"""You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.""So vast and diverse is his dominion, that the Khan will not ever get to visit each of the conquered cities. Thus, the Khn listens to the adventurous Marco Polo, who describes the cities that he has seen through his voyages. His tales prove to be more onirical than useful, and while the fantastical cities are certainly amusing to imagine, larger than time, lighter than air, heavier than light... they passed through me leaving nothing behind. Marco Polo's translucid cities of transparent cathedrals and weightless bridges, filled to the brim with invisible people... when I reached out to them and tried to keep a word or two, I opened my fist to find nothing within: just as Marco Polo in the memory of the Khan, the book and the cities had dissapeared, and with it all my memories of them.Some of the cities genious designs and origins deserve to be experienced, at least virtually, in a videogame or a movie, as this book feels so severely limited.Lastly, I know Calvino's imagination is not Borges' in magnitude, and I'm also not one for poetry, but I do wonder if reading it in Italian (a more melodic language than English) would have made these tales more memorable.TL;DR Do not expect to learn anything about any cities in this one.

Ramsay Eyre,"This book is more of a prose poem collection than a novel. The writing is beautifully impressionistic, but unlike other philosophical novels, there is no moment at which the author's precise goal became overwhelmingly clear--at least in my first reading of it.

Horatio,"This was really weird. I didn't like it. I don't really know what else to say about this one. It was written as a conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, with Polo sharing about all the cities that he's visited, though I think they were imaginary. The writing was beautiful yet bizarre, and it was purely aesthetic writing with no purpose.

Panos Tsiareas,"A favourite. Calvino manages to capture the absurdity of a city (that is the concept of a city and not a particular city per se) along with its incredible ability of representing life as it is: a continuous procedure of going back (memory), of wants and needs (desire), of signs that seek interpretation, of trades and dealings, of names / many names / names which tend to be the signified rather than the signifier.

Icarus (Sonny),"This book has a good premise, and the blurb describes it in a way that is very appealing to me. Unfortunately the book itself is quite a mess. The descriptions of the “cities” are too short to get me invested in Calvino’s vision of them, and the writing isn’t provocative enough to imbue me with the sense of wonder that I would have hoped to feel.

This plotless book doesn't have to be read in page order. If I were to read this again, I would probably read by the type of city, so the theme across each type is more apparent.

Patrick Hackett,"A gorgeous piece of literature.“The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corner of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennas of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls.”",2019-12-01 13:38:13,5,en,2019-12-01 13:38:13,12,2019,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,58
Christopher Benassi,"Another reviewer described this well - as a ""lucid dream""I wanted to like this book, but it really didn't click for me.

Tom,"A stonking act of imagination with Calvino's characteristic playfulness. It toys with paradoxes and encourages readers to read signs out of spires and sand.

H Iamarino,I love Calvino's prose. He brilliantly expands simple situations and ideas to become more and more poetic as it dives into Fantasy. And Invisible Cities is just another hit!

Rishav Agarwal,Invisible cities reminded me of an anime called Kino’s Journey. The anime follows Kino travelling to surreal cities. Cavallo’s Marco Polo also talks about arbitrary cities with strange inhabitants. Each city reminds you of a place you’ve been to and of another you wanted to visit.

Sofie,"Kublai Khan and Marco Polo in conversation about travels to cities at the ends of the world - cities like dreams, labyrinths of thought, where perhaps an answer lies at the exit? The plotless narrative has the feel of a poem, and in the beginning, this made me enjoy it less. But then the descriptions come alive, the cities have personalities, they are figures, metaphors, and become filled with substance. In my mind, Calvino breaks ground every time.Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes. For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.

Bowdoin,"Reader in group- One of my favorite books is Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino. Translated from the original Italian, it follows the surreal conversations between fictionalized versions of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Divided into simple sections titled like, ""Cities and Memory"" or ""Cities and the Dead,"" Polo describes the interesting places he has (possibly) encountered. Each short episode challenges the way one looks at cities and the people who live in them.

Adrian,"A series of parables in the form of descriptions of fantastical cities. Framed by a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, which also becomes a parable. A short book, but dense and difficult to absorb. Meant to be read slowly and reread, however I don't see myself doing it. For all its beauty and profundity, I find many of the cities to be forgettable. There are less than 10 out of, what, 50? that I love and care to visit again. For positives, I love the surreal in any case, and I appreciated how some of the cities gradually begin to display technology and aspects of the modern world despite the frame story taking place on the cusp of the Late Middle Age.Judging strictly from my personal enjoyment I'd rate it as low as a 2.5, but I must respect Calvino's mastery and the quality of the work.",2022-03-08 01:42:26,4,en,2022-03-08 01:42:26,3,2022,0.00058,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,149

lucas,"This book feels purposefully ambiguous to come across as deep. Asking my friends about what they thought really just cemented this. Literally none of them had similar interpretations, probably because the book relies on how far the reader could reach for an interpretation. So I guess what I got out of those discussions was just how creative my friends could be. The book gets repetitive really quick, so it's not like coming up with something was even a fun thing to do. The only redeemable quality for me was the somewhat reflective dialogues between Polo and Khan, but even then they still end up feeling ""fake deep"". I might get the appeal here, but it's just not my thing to read about variations of the same thing for 160 pages.

Taylor Norman,"“But the special quality of this city for the man who arrives there on a September evening, when the days are growing shorter and the multicolored lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls and from a terrace a woman’s voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy toward those who now believe they have once before lived an evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that time” (7). “All this so that Marco Polo could explain or imagine explaining or be imagined explaining or succeed finally in explaining to himself that what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveler’s past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which each day that goes by adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places” (28-9). “No one remembers what need or command or desire drove Zenobia’s founders to give their city this form, and so there is no telling whether it was satisfied by the city as we see it today, which has perhaps grown though successive superimpositions from the first, now undecipherable plan. But what is certain is that if you ask an inhabitant of Zenobia to describe his vision of a happy life, it is always a city like Zenobia that he imagines, with its pilings and its suspended stairways, a Zenobia perhaps quite different, a-flutter with banners and ribbons, but always derived by combining elements of that first model.	This said, it is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it” (35). “‘You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.’	‘Or the question it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx’” (44). “The ancients built Valdrada on the shores of a lake, with houses all verandas one above the other, and high streets whose railed parapets look out over the water. Thus the traveler, arriving, sees two cities: one erect above the lake, and the other reflected, upside down. Nothing exists or happens in the one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat, because the city was so constructed that its every point would be reflected in its mirror, and the Valdrada down in the water contains not only all the flutings and juttings of the facades that rise above the lake, but also the rooms’ interiors with ceilings and floors, the perspective of the halls, the mirrors of the wardrobes.	Valdrada’s inhabitants know that each of their actions is, at once, that action and its mirror-image, which possesses the special dignity of images, and this awareness prevents them from succumbing for a single moment to change and forgetfulness. Even when lovers twist their naked bodies, skin against skin, seeking the position that will give one the most pleasure in the other, even when murderers plunge the knife into the black veins of the neck and more clotted blood pours out the more they press the blade that slips between the tendons, it is not so much their copulating or murdering that matters as the copulating or murdering of the images, limpid and cold in the mirror” (53). “If you choose to believe me, good” (75). “‘Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,’ Polo said. ‘Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little’” (87). “‘I speak and speak,’ Marco says. ‘but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories. It is not the voice that commands the story; it is the ear’” (135). “‘The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space’” (165).",2016-11-02 04:14:59,0,en,2016-11-02 04:14:59,11,2016,0.00118,0.0001,0.00018,0.00012,0.0002,0.00016,910

Invisible city consists of poem and fiction that speaks in a language of symbols and images, describe the city that people move along, see through it differently while reflect their own souls, ambitions, desires and fears.Calvino dreamed a world that is more real than reality, with all the ingredients needed to build a city: memories, desires, signs, skies, trade, eyes, sounds, shapes, names and the dead. Throughout the story, every city, whether imagined by Calvino or constructed by planned blueprints or grown from slow accretion, are all dreams given shape by human hands, by human ambition, by a desire for a future that can be shaped.Calvino demonstrates through invisible city that imagination is imagery, as we become more explicit and speak more of it, it vanishes little by little, and it will eventually be erased once it is fixed in structured texts. But the listener retains only the words they are expecting, it is not the voice and words that paint the imagination, it is the ear and the eye.",2018-04-08 13:14:11,4,en,2018-04-08 13:14:11,4,2018,0.00068,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,216

Justin A. M.,"One of my least fond childhood memories is when my family took a trip through Las Vegas. I was old enough at this time to know its reputation, with its institutionalized gambling and sequined Elvis and that primetime NBC show big around that time, that I thought I had a pretty good grip on my expectations. But after the drive through some sprawling desert, we wandered the night through scummy and exhaust-choked sidewalks where drunk 20-somethings yelled at pedestrians from limousine sunrooves and the ground was littered with trading cards with Playboy-type trading cards whose corner-dwelling dealers were shuffling their wares even to me (just a wee lad), and the famed casinos I saw only from the outside (because, again, I was just a wee lad). By the end, my main impressions were how hard it was to breathe in the city and how much my feet hurt from the walking. I don't even remember any Elvises. Defying the city's mantra, I ended up taking that experience with me, well outside, even to when I tell of it now. And I'm also sure that, in this telling, I've remembered it a bit differently than I perceived it then, and my perception of it then was, too, far from everything that Vegas has, that Vegas boasts to be, or that Vegas which other people remember, or don't and piece together the morning after.""Invisible Cities,"" then, is something of a handbook for chipping at the question: What was the city I visited? Meeting at an intersection of fiction and poetry, Calvino's book documents the accounts of cities from Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, ruler of an empire too vast for him to appreciate. Despite the characters, though, it hits spot-on a feeling of timelessness, where ancient cities mingle with those apparently of the present with those not yet or ever possible. And each of these accounts, too, refuses simply to describe a city but rather to question what that city even is.Through its beautiful descriptions of architecture and populations, it asks:	-Which is more of a city: its place or its people?	-What shapes a city more: its physical structure or our perception?	-What more characterizes a city: its reputation or our experiences?	-How do we know the city: by its buildings or by signs on and in the buildings?And many more.It's heritage, then, is clearly of the sort that questions objectivity (that we can know a city as it actually ""is"") and emphasizes the notion that no city -- or anything, really -- is separate from its beholder. And though the books poetic forms has repetition of a theme built in, I never had the impression that the accounts, by the end, became redundant. The build atop each other, or modulate the theme, or contrast one assumption with another. In my own experience reading it, I kept a deck of index cards to untangle the descriptions, and by the end, each city still felt fresh, meaningful, and important to the overall question, even if the book isn't so much concerned with answering things as much as it is with showing that certain things can't be so easily answered.More importantly, however, is that the book isn't just a discourse on city planning remixed in a post-(modern/structural/whatever) way; instead, the way cities and all their elements are discussed allows them to stand in for a discussion of how people themselves move around in the world, how they interact with others, how they have a sense of self from a sense of place, and all the other topics you might find in a modern lit. course (students looking to impress stodgy profs, take note). There is a story, in some sense: it's not important for the plot. It's driven entirely by these ideas above. At worst, then, this book may come off as a catalog of city-concepts, which may or may not be real, which may just be the written navel-gaze to an uncharitable reader. At best, and as I found generally for my own case, the book begs for a reconsideration of how you think you see the world around you, a reminder of all the things you take for granted and all the things you now do automatically after years around the same place. If you find stagnation around you, then the book says: look again. And if you then think you've got it right, the book says: guess again.In my thoughts of Las Vegas after the read, I don't really know what I interacted with: again, the book complicates more than it answers. It was an experience in which reputation met filtered experience met memory met probably something else. They all meet in the first paragraph, which, if I was really trying to ditch my self-awareness, I might have named ""Las Vegas."" But I'm not an artist: I lost too much back then, breathing in the fumes and staring slackjawed and hypnotized at the neon lights of the city. 	There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return.",2016-04-09 11:13:21,4,en,2016-04-09 11:13:21,4,2016,0.00086,0.00012,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,846
Aditya Raghav,"HIDDEN CITIES • 2 In Raissa, life is not happy. People wring their hands as they walk in the streets, curse the crying children, lean on the railings over the river and press their fists to their temples. In the morning you wake from one bad dream and another begins. At the workbenches where, every moment, you hit your finger with a hammer or prick it with a needle, or over the columns of figures all awry in the ledgers of merchants and bankers, or at the rows of empty glasses on the zinc counters of the wineshops, the bent heads at least conceal the general grim gaze. Inside the houses, it is worse, and you do not have to enter to learn this: in the summer the windows resound with quarrels and broken dishes.And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, “Darling, let me dip into it,” to a young serving-maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at having painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow in the illumination of that page in the volume where the philosopher says: “Also in Raissa, city of sadness, there runs an invisible thread that binds one living being to another for a moment, then unravels, then is stretched again between moving points as it draws new and rapid patterns so that at every second the unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence.”",2019-01-10 20:39:56,5,en,2019-01-10 20:39:56,1,2019,0.00628,0.0001,0.00031,0.00014,0.00044,0.00025,346

Tso William,"Reading the Invisible Cities reminds me of Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams. The writers of both write purely descriptive prose to present certain abstract ideas but the similarity ends there. Whereas Einstein's Dreams presents prose on concepts of time and thereby explores a series of hypothetical thought experiments, Invisible Cities is ostensibly about cities, of course, but Calvino is more ambitious. The fifty five imaginary cities and the conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo are merely the vehicles for him to explore wider issues like language, human nature, human relationship, fate, etc. The result is mixed. Some of them are truly profound, like the cities about reincarnation, or maze constructed by desires, or trading for memories. Sometimes Calvino seems to insinuate some profundities but the readers end up being puzzled, not understanding what he is trying to say. When that happens, the prose becomes hollow and pretentious. The same applies to the conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Calvino might wish to say something by not saying them but instead plays with words in their conversations.  Invisible Cities is an interesting book. It is a short book and may be something eludes me because of such brevity. A second reading might reveal something more to me.",2016-10-05 23:01:58,3,en,2016-10-05 23:01:58,10,2016,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,208

Whiskey Tango,"Fearing that his empire’s vastness has made it “an endless, formless ruin,” Kublai Khan asks the traveler Marco Polo to describe it to him so he might understand and thereby control it. What Polo offers are accounts of surreal places—“hidden cities,” “trading cities,” and “thin cities” (whose buildings have no walls, floors or ceilings)—inhabited by people whose actions seem inexplicable in this novel of ideas concerned with memory and time, language and community, and the landscapes of the physical world and the imagination.*******I have traveled with Marco Polo to visit the 55 cities conquered by Kublai Khan. Khan desires to ascertain, measure, consolidate, and preserve his kingdom; however, the cities refuse to submit to his imagination. Each of these invisible cities has a unique personality that coexists with the blended identity of positive and negative, exotic and mundane, industrious and lazy, salubrious and suicidal. Each reader will discover his own metaphor for the invisible cities. To me, these cities are not mere fanciful descriptions of geographical locations. Instead, they are the fragments of: the mysterious life that I have led; the experiences endured; the books read; the women loved; the illusions lost; and the memories forgotten and awakened. Each city presents a recognizable (yet invisible) fragment of me to myself in all its exceptions, exclusions, incongruities and contradictions. This is a journey through my own inner atlas. Whom do I trust? Do I trust writers? On the one hand: “falsehood is never in words, it is in the things.” On the other hand:“there is no language without deceit.” Therefore, I have happy city-selves where I see“a girl walking with a puma on a leash,”  and I have unhappy city-states where another girl “with a laughing skull milks the carcass of a heifer.” The erotic and the dangerous intertwine and seduce while they threaten. When I listen to Marco Polo describe cities to quizzical Khan, I overhear myself, and I also overhear the internal debate between the visionary and the skeptical voices inside my own skull. The dialectical voices try, fail, quit, and renew the quixotic attempt to make sense out of the absurd variety of life. We cannot penetrate the mystery, nor can we detect the patterns. Indeed, we cannot even assume the coherence and benevolence of the designer, but we can celebrate her fecund creativity and febrile imagination. Or can we? Each city’s name is unmemorable and virtually indistinguishable from the other 54 generic names. Normally, the act of bestowing a name implies power and knowledge in possession of the owner. But these names might have been generated by a computer for Toyota in order to evoke vague desire and nostalgia within consumers. (Camry, Celica, Corolla, Auris, Allion, Avensis, and Yaris). Each city’s description is “voluptuous vibration” that is short and nearly incomprehensible. After a while, the names and the details run together like the invisible cities whose centers cannot be distinguished from the boundary with its surrounding plains. Each book I read is a frustrating and pleasurable intercourse with an invisible city. Sometimes I am blocked at her hesitant vulva; sometimes I touch her cervix. I alternated between both experiences in my journey to Calvino’s cities, and I have made a similar journey with Jorge Luis Borges-- who showed me invisible cities and the invisible libraries of invisible books, consisting of invisible words. Calvino is the literary son of the blind patriarch, Borges, and Calvino is the elder compatriot of Umberto Eco. Each fabulist seduces our imagination with abstract, conceptual, and erudite writing. Until darkness extinguishes my exhausted and finite mind, I will keep reading this nebula of writers who introduce me to myself and who light my imagination with infinite possibilities. Calvino played Marco Polo on my journey to consolidate the kingdom of myself. After exploring my 55 selves, I have witnessed contradictory visions that please and provoke me. I regret that I will have only one life in which to make my meandering journey. Yet, I dream of promised lands, not recorded in the atlas of Khan, where all my future selves “are already present in this instant, wrapped one within the other, confined, crammed, inextricable.”  I also await the discovery of a hidden city, like Marozia, where fanciful swallows erupt in flight over the ""grim and petty rattish dominion.""",2018-03-12 07:00:00,5,en,2018-03-12 07:00:00,3,2018,0.00795,0.00012,0.00055,0.0002,0.00057,0.00032,716

Jessica,"""You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours. Or the question it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.""What to say about this gem of a book? Firstly, this is my favorite Calvino so far. I wanted to read it because I'm stuck at home in the age of COVID and I've been nostalgic for traveling. Invisible Cities did not disappoint on that count, but it is not only a book about traveling. Calvino has many insightful points to make in interesting ways, such as…How people see a thing and the words people use to describe it are very different than what a thing (i.e. a city) actually is.While the act of traveling is a physical journey, it is also, perhaps more importantly, a mental journey. Traveling is important because it teaches you things you didn't know about yourself.Traveling can enlarge your view of the world and help you realize things you could do to make your own home better.I've read three Calvino works so far, and I've found that Calvino is best read in small portions because you'll want time to think about what he's saying and really absorb it. He is not perhaps the most accessible writer, but he always has something interesting and important to say, and Invisible Cities is no different.Some favorite quotes below:""The traveler’s past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which each day that goes by adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.""""With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear.

Christopher Murtagh,"I don't know why I am giving this book a five star rating as it isn't perfect. I think because this genre of prose poetry is very rare, and this might be the first of its type. It is not without faults, some of the wisdom is a little like the old proverb of reversing things, fortune cookie wisdom, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for you country type reversal.Another fault is the rambling almost annoying whimsy. Another is the repetition. And it is a very unforgiving work, don't concentrate for a second and you might miss a vital word and find you don't know what's going on. In fact most of the pieces need a good second or third read to understand, like poetry. Though the book is slight, that is quite deceptive. This book will last as long as a novel at least. It is like Parmesan, fine super concentrated cheese that needs savoring. Talking about cheese, it is indeed cheesy. Beautiful though too. Its philosophy is a little vague and drippy. Faults are plenty, sure. But a few great images. Some real things to say. I liked it.",2020-08-31 03:32:33,5,en,2020-08-31 03:32:33,8,2020,0.00177,0.0001,0.00021,0.00011,0.00021,0.00016,199

John Lawson,"Marco Polo tries to entertain Kublai Khan with tales of his journeys. Exaggeration almost certainly ensues.I really liked the initial descriptions of the fantastic cities at first. By the second half, it seemed like he began to run out of ideas, as they seemed to begin repeating themes.The prose is wonderfully dream-like, the concepts nonsensical. I couldn't figure out the seemingly random chapter numbering. I'm sure there's some kind of relevance that I'm not clever enough to understand. And in-between blocks of chapters are interludes where emperor and explorer chat about the meanings of the cities discussed.

Sembray,"I have always felt slightly silly ranking Italo Calvino as one of my favourite authors, as I had only read one of his books. However, after finishing this he leaves with me choice. While I did prefer If On A Winter's Night A Traveller, Invisible Cities is still an absolutely brilliant novel.This is an impossible book to describe, mainly thanks to its utterly unconventional structure and plot. It's not even 200 pages long and yet I feel like I'm nowhere near understanding it or how I feel about it. All I can really say is that it's a challenging, thought-provoking and completely unique linguistic experiment which explores aspects of human nature through the cities we inhabit and how we describe them. This is definitely not an easy read, and it isn't even strictly enjoyable in a traditional sense. However, as a mirror to reflect upon the human psyche and the power of language and storytelling, this is an unparalleled achievement that I can't recommend highly enough.",2022-10-17 20:39:54,5,en,2022-10-17 20:39:54,10,2022,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,166
Linda C,"The 'novel' is made up of dialogues between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo interspersed with descriptions/ruminations on many cities Polo has seen/imagined. Some descriptions were more memorable than others. There is always the question as to what is real, if anything, considering the use of objects and topics not invented at Marco Polo's time. So the ruminations of the author cover cities as sights, desires, memory, signs, names and place. City chapters I particularly liked were Irene (a city seen from afar but never entered), Eutropia (a city of smaller cities where people change jobs and lives by moving to the next small city when they become weary of the first), and Octavia (a city built in a net suspended between two cliffs over a chasm).

Erika,"Yet this is an interesting read, you sit and think about it trying to come up with a review or insights that you've taken from this book. In general, this book does not have a clear plot, or some strongly built characters. For me it was more like a bunch of puzzle pieces which not necessary are adding or even should add up to some clear picture. It's purely up to you what you will do with that puzzle, either try to put it into some view or just enjoy each piece separately. The most clear what you can get here is the classification of short stories for a different group, e.g. cities and the sky, hidden cities, cities and trades, cities and memories, which helps you in a way to put that short story into at least some view. However, I believe this book and all of the stories are full of experience in it and it surely depends on you how much of it will you take.

Jackie,"I have always found that a book worth reading is one that challenges the reader to think differently than he or she normally would. Invisible Cities was one of those books. Not only did I find myself engaged in the book’s philosophy but I was amazed by how well each piece of the book fit into the story. The story itself is not a very easy one to explain, as I found it a little tough, at first, to understand what was truly going on. Once I got past that initial phase, however, I began to really appreciate the book. Italo Calvino was remarkably descriptive in his writing and I enjoyed his style for he was able to capture so many ideas through words. This fictional book is not structured the way that I am used to, which made it very interesting. The chapters, which conventionally enhance the plotline or move it forward, focused solely on cities (one city for each chapter). There was a prologue at the beginning, which gave insight into the two main characters, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Polo was a Venetian merchant while Khan ruled Yuan Empire (both of which were based on the actual people). I found the dynamic between the two to be great. Polo was fairly young and yet he seemed to have a maturity and poise similar to that of the Emperor himself. Emperor Kublai Khan ruled as a Chinese emperor and sent out envoys to check on the cities of his vast empire. Then he met Polo. The Venetian merchant did not speak Khan’s language but Polo developed a way to express his travels through a multitude of signs, symbols, and gestures. Out of everyone else, Marco Polo was the only one that the Emperor found the most interest in. Kublai Khan did not, however, fully trust everything that the young man described. There was a sense of mistrust between the two as noted in the quote; “The other ambassadors warn me of famines, extortions, conspiracies, or else they inform me of newly discovered turquoise mines, advantageous prices in marten furs, suggestions for supplying damascened blades. And you? …you return from lands equally distant and you can tell me only the thoughts that come to a man who sits on his doorstep at evening to enjoy the cool air. What is the use, then, of all your travelling?” (p.27) Life was an important topic of the book and Calvino handled it in a way that I had never seen before. The cities that Polo explained were the embodiment of humanity because each city, no matter how ideal or perfect, were not. I immediately thought of how true Calvino’s view was.(Possible spoiler)This brought up a much deeper thought: Were the cities real? I believed so, at first, until I read further. Whether or not this is true, there was something about the way the cities were portrayed that almost didn’t seem real, for example, he described a city as one that never, “touches the earth except those long flamingo legs on which it rests…” (p.77)(End of spoiler) Polo, in short, was a dreamer, as he described each city through his own perspective. He looked at cities and saw them in so many unimaginable ways, for some technological advances did not exist at the time. Kublai Khan, on the other hand, was a man who was focused on the future of his empire. He strived for perfection and hoped to one day shape the empire into a utopia. Khan learned, however, that his empire was not an invisible force and could eventually crumble from the inside. To say that Invisible Cities was a story inside a story would be an understatement because this was heavily layered with different perspectives. One of the only weaknesses of the book that I found was the context. This wasn’t the easiest book to read and I had to read certain sections over to fully understand them. Whether that was Calvino’s intention or not, I felt that this may have taken away from the book a bit. I was amazed, however, by the relevance that the book had about humanity. I could see bits our modern day society in each of the cities and unfortunately not all of what I found was positive. Calvino took a realist approach when dealing with that theme and I admire him for being true to life in that sense. I would recommend this book to young adults and older because of the complex and multi-dimensional story.",2013-06-03 11:06:43,4,en,2013-06-03 11:06:43,6,2013,0.0007,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,755
Marianna,"At first glance, this is a book about imaginary cities, cities that have never existed and will never exist. As such, some of them are extremely imaginative: the hanging city, the pipe city, the city that expanded from within... Although they are unreal, they challenge our perception about what a city looks like and why it looks so. But is is also a book about real cities, their differences and similarities, the way we perceive them and interact with them, and the way we interact with other people inside cities. Sometimes the author does not talk about cities at all. I will admit that after a while the format becomes a little repetitive and tiring but for me the insights of the author made it worth it. I would add to that that the language is beautiful and the discussions between Marco Polo and the emperor with their melancholic, dreamy atmosphere and reflections are another highlight of the book",2022-02-16 01:27:02,5,en,2022-02-16 01:27:02,2,2022,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,159
Gina,"What do you do when the setting of a story is no setting at all? What about when it is multiple settings at once?In Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino I explored cities through the descriptions and imagination of Marco Polo. The Venetian tells emperor Kublai Khan about each land of his empire. Since the two don’t speak the same language, Polo uses objects from his travels to explain each city, knowing all along that Khan will interpret it in his own way – just as the reader must interpret each city in his own way.“I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. … It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.”I could empathize with their language barrier because I read the novel in Italian, my adopted language and the novel’s original language. Sitting in the emperor’s garden the two speak through gestures, through objects, sometimes without even speaking at all, traveling together throughout the empire through the descriptions of Polo.It’s appropriate that I read the book in Italian. The difference in language only aided my journey into lands that exist and yet simultaneously don’t exist. As Polo and Khan slipped fluidly from lucidity to haziness, I slipped fluidly from understanding to uncertainty.Not only because I was reading in a language that was not my own, but because of Calvino’s inherently ambiguous descriptions. It’s not that they’re impossible to understand, but that they’re written purposefully to be interpreted in multiple ways, just like Khan interprets Polo or like a traveler interprets a city.In the beginning of the novel Polo describes a man he comes across in Khan’s court who is in another world on opium. The feel of the scene – the man calmly living halfway in the real world and halfway in the clouds, surrounded by a hazy swirl of smoke drifting from the pipe – is similar to the feel of the novel. Only when I set the novel down did I begin to grasp its content, to realize how much space was covered without ever leaving the emperor’s garden.In just 165 pages Calvino covers 55 cities. Divided into nine chapters, each city is categorized along a certain theme, such as memories, desire, names or the dead. There’s Despina, the city that can only be approached by crossing a desert, either one of water or of sand, each option changing how the city is viewed by the traveler. There’s Octavia, a spider-web city suspended in the air whose inhabitants are more sure than others, because they at least have the certainty that sooner or later the web will break. There are cities with earth where there should be air and cities with the dead on earth and the living buried deep.You could argue that Invisible Cities is a suggestion for how a city could be. Architects can study the possibilities and communities can study the humanity. For me it’s an experiment with the concepts of travel and place, of movement and stillness. At one point Khan angers and yells at Polo to tell him the truth, to stop describing cities that are all the same. But a traveler’s bias comes from his background.“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice.”A city is a living element, sometimes changing constantly and other times being buried unmoved. It’s a combination of ideas and thought experiments, created by the individual minds that live it.“For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.”There are no set answers offered in Invisible Cities, just like there are often no set answers found while traveling or, for example, found in another language. If anything, with each new word, each new city, each turn of the page, a new idea is discovered along with the foundations of a city. It’s a book to be read again and again – maybe next time in a different language!",2013-09-03 18:56:29,5,en,2013-09-03 18:56:29,9,2013,0.00072,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,724
Bree,"""It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""
Italo Calvino’s  Invisible Cities  is an intriguingly complex little novel which reflects on the ideas of memory, place, desire and language in relation to cities real and imagined we have all in some way come into contact with. Told over a series of fragmentary tales describing different cities as discussed between the Venetian explorer Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, Emperor of the Tartars (a name most would connect with Coleridge’s A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment), Calvino’s work is a thought-provoking exploration of the city in its myriad of majestic forms, both dark and light; real and imagined. Beginning as a discussion between the Khan, who fears the decline of his own empire, and Polo, who regals the Emperor with almost unbelievable descriptions of cities traveled to far and wide, as the dialogue continues it becomes increasingly evident to the reader that in all his tales (of cities like Phyllis with its “variety of windows” suspended over bridges and canals or Isaura, the city “that moves entirely upward”) Polo may indeed be describing just one place: Venice. In a 2004 journal article published in  Columbia: A Journal of Literature and Art , Calvino reflects on the idea that  Invisible Cities is “written something like a last love poem addressed to the city, at a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult to live there. It looks, indeed, as if we are approaching a period of crisis in urban life; and  Invisible Cities is like a dream born out of the heart of the unliveable cities we know” (180-1). As someone who has both lived and studied in the city of Venice, and thus has a particular appreciation and love for this city, I think Calvino’s work is exactly that and maybe just a little bit more. This is a work that plays on memory and imagination, a work that I assume elicits a different response in every reader because it challenges them actually picture each unbelievable city as they come to pass. Calvino isn’t trying to sell us a particular type of utopia, instead he is challenging us to understand that a “city if a combination of many things: memory, desires, signs of language; it is a place of exchange…[and that] these exchanges are not just trade in goods, they also involve words, desires and memories” (181). As a student living in this beautiful city, this is a lesson I learnt every single day as I walked down cobblestone streets, traversed over bridges and gazed out over the watery depths of the lagoon. So when Calvino describes the different windows in Phyllis I can see the mismatched windows scattered throughout the various campos and calles by the cities immigrants. When he describes Isaura as the “city of the thousand wells” I see the infrastructure which brought fresh drinking water and survival to a people surrounded by salt water. And then there is Tamara, the city of signs, which reminds me of Venice’s material history, of the figures etched along the columns that support the Doge’s Palace, of the image of St Mark’s Lion, of the artworks created by masters to tell the story of this great city, all languages in their own right preserving a myth long before its audience could read or write and existing long after this great city had fallen.I often wonder what it would be like if everyone who visited Venice could see the city like I do, could appreciate more than just the obligatory glance at the San Macro and the Rialto Bridge before moving on to their next great adventure, could see Venice as more than just a tourist destination that needs to be visited before it sinks into the waters which for so many centuries have remained a maritime refuge. Calvino’s  Invisible Cities , whilst both a complex and a times droning read, therefore challenges the reach of our own conceptions of memory and imagination; place and time. It means something different to each of us, which is why the ear who listens to the story is so important, it makes it a work I can truly appreciate and no doubt have still much to learn from in the future. 4 Stars.",2017-08-10 15:17:07,4,en,2017-08-10 15:17:07,8,2017,0.00072,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,718

Natasha,"I struggle to find words to describe this book. The book which is framed as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where he describes various cities that he encountered on his travels. Each of the 55 cities is virtually a prose poem, and in reading them, you end up reflecting on death, time, and human experiences. One tiny excerpt will explain better than words ever could.Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. “But which is the stone that supports the bridge?” Kubla Khan asks.“The bridge is not supported by one stone or another”, Marco answers, “but by the line of the arch that they form.”Kulba khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: “Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.”Polo answers: “Without stones, there is no arch.""What was not immediately apparent was the structure of the book. The 55 cities are divided into 11 thematic groups of 5 cities each, which are arranged in a strict mathematical structure.

Nemanja,"""With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.""In a fictitious conversation between Marco Polo and Genghis Khan, Calvino, in accordance with the female names he gives them, lyrically describes the cities that Polo visited on his travels. Thus, Polo describes to Khan how memories, mementos, acquaintances and experiences affect our perception of cities and how cities are constantly being shaped and changed by the new settlers; he melancholy recounts to him about the decline of once famous districts, old centers and green areas; makes Khan aware with symbols of various cities by which they are recognizable; retells legends that make cities mysterious and myths about their origins, etc. always keeping his native Venice in mind. In Calvino's recognizable innovative style, the stories alternate symmetrically from the beginning to the end, and can be read both chronologically or thematically, and after each unit, as a relief, a fictitious philosophical-existentialist conversation between Khan and Polo is presented, showing the complexity of their mutual relationship, their daydreams, desires and experiences.Калвино у фиктивном разговору између Марка Пола и Џингис Кана, у складу са женским именима која им надењује, лирски описује градове које је Поло посетио на својим путовањима.

Nathaniel Fletcher,"A charming and intriguing experiment in which Calvino uses cities to tell stories about about peoples and vise versa.A fantasy to discuss the reality of the relationships that exists between us and our cities.Calvino has a remarkable gift of making you fall in love with a subject or hobby, that I've never quite experienced before.I will stop myself here, as it's all to easy to make Calvino's work sound less accessable than it really is.

Joni Baboci,"Calvino's Invisible Cities is an amazing poetical and philosophical take on the city and the meaning of being human. The author takes the reader on a fantastic trip of architectural details, right, wrong, and grey. It visits 11 sets of 5 imaginary cities located in an imaginary empire. Each city has its specific subtleties described in a couple of pages. Aesthetic features and general organization is concisely covered but - like the city of Tamara - the form of the city has a hidden meaning. Each city a message. All kinds of awesome concepts are implemented - the city of Zora for example is described as the preeminent memory palace. The city of Leandra explores the concept of what is a house and by extension the city. Is the essence the form and the structure or the spirit of those that inhabit it. There is Eutropia - a utopian Europe of sorts - a city of multiple cities, where from time to time, when people are bored they change their work/wife/family/home and live in perpetual movement. There is Octavia - the barely hanging there city; and Baucis the city with legs. There is Olinda - the city that grows from the center. The new quarters are created in the center of town while the old city expands outwards pushing the oldest Olindia at the fringes of the metropolis. The cities usually represent a contrasting concept - each is independent and self-defeating and yet each feels part of its quintuple before being part of the empire.Mostly the cities are extremely original - some of them however might serve as conceptual blueprints of a new, better type of city; a city that goes beyond mere functional and efficient planning, making the bettering of the life of its inhabitants its central goal. This makes the book seem a slight critique - or rather a commentary of globalization and modernism in architecture.Magical realism is what makes the book work. The two main characters are Khubilai Khan and Marco Polo. The emperor and his ambassador. It is mentioned that they cannot speak the same language and try to find novel ways to communicate. Before and after every round of five cities a conversation between the two of them takes place. Real cities are mentioned shortly during the dialogues - putting the imagined cities and the real ones in a similar plane. Magical realism however works best with the temporal and geographical aspects of the book. Although because of Khubilai Khan one gets the feeling of an ancient oriental empire, often the author includes airports and all kinds of modern urban features into the game.Structurally each city is part of a series and each series comes up cyclically until its five cities are exhausted. The book has some meta element to it - structurally similar to GEB - where cities loop in one another and parts of them are found in other cities.This was the second time I read the book, but the first time that I did so in Italian. I love reading in Italian - and I especially enjoy doing so out-loud. The more poetic the work, the better this awesome language sounds.“L’inferno dei viventi non è qualcosa che sarà; se ce n’è uno, è quello che è già qui, l’inferno che abitiamo tutti i giorni, che formiamo stando insieme. Due modi ci sono per non soffrirne. Il primo riesce facile a molti: accettare l’inferno e diventarne parte fino al punto di non vederlo più. Il secondo è rischioso ed esige attenzione e apprendimento continui: cercare e saper riconoscere chi e cosa, in mezzo all’inferno, non è inferno, e farlo durare, dargli spazio.” - Italo Calvino",2012-04-29 05:10:55,5,en,2012-04-29 05:10:55,4,2012,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,612
Jeroen,"There is one city, Marco Polo began to say to Kublai Khan, which is merely the size of a shoebox, yet it contains every other city in the world. It contains the oranges that ripen on the boughs in your garden, the silk that flows like golden thread across your empire, and the concubines which brighten up even those darkest of realms in the north of your empire which remain mostly hearsay to us here. It contains the cities of Venice and Samarkand, of Isfahan and Istanbul. In it are the most glorious sounds of the best of all the musicians the empire harbours.Surely there is no such thing, the emperor said, yet in his eyes one could already discern the glow of appreciation at the idea of holding the whole empire in the palms of his bare hands. Surely not, he repeated, in a sound urging Polo to continue, to unveil his secrets.Yes, said Polo, there is such a thing, but there is one condition to this city's abundance.What is it, asked Khan. Surely there can be no cost high enough that it is not balanced out by the pleasures of the entire empire.The condition, said Marco Polo, a mischievous smile playing around his lips, is that it is immaterial. Within this shoebox, the whole empire can be conjured up, yet it does not live and breathe. Yes, it is the harmonious sound of the best musicians, the sight of the most beautiful silk dresses, yet it is not the bittersweet smell of the oranges, the soft caress of the beautiful woman. Your hands move right through the illusion, like a <em>fata morgana</em>, and grasp at mere dust, like grains of sand slipping through your fingers.Surely that is no better than a taunt, Khan retorted, angry now. Who would want such a thing?You would be surprised, said Polo. Thousands flock toward this city to marvel at this shoebox. They queue up for hours to gaze for a moment into the box, to listen to its whispers. What they want is to be able to gaze at what they have always wanted to gaze at, to listen to what they have always wanted to listen to. The city is a loyal servant, a genie giving one what it wishes. But something strange happens on the way out, when they walk away from it. They are disillusioned, dispirited. They have gotten what they wanted, and now they are still here, still living the same life. But it is more than that. They conjured up all the cities of their dreams, those cities of renown, and they could see that they were all the same. They were all the same, because they all held the same people: merchants, kings, beggars and artisans, farmers and servants; all of them contained beautiful women but also ugly ones, faces friendly and unfriendly. In each of them walked sad men to balance out the happy ones. In each of them, the gazers now realised, their life would still be their life: to eat, sleep and work, and sometimes, if one is lucky, to love.Then why are they sad, Kublai Khan asked, with the unworldly innocence exclusive to an emperor. They just learned that they are all living in the best city in the world. They should be happy.You are right, of course, Marco Polo quickly responded. It is just in the first moments after the box that they are sad. They have to walk back into their own life, grow into it again. When they do, they will feel better than ever, and they will live for the first time in the present, without yearning after things that are unreachable. They realise that their city is the best city in the world because every city is the same city. Every city, that is, except one: that shoebox which merely separates, which keeps the world at a remove. The meaning of the world is to be in it. This is the truth the shoebox helps prove.",2016-05-16 19:23:56,3,en,2016-05-16 19:23:56,5,2016,0.00121,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.0002,0.00017,669

Kate Kitsumritphol,"A thought-provoking - if perhaps a little too thorough - journey through places, memories, and imaginationsMy first experience with reading Italo Calvino was Cosmicomics and, truth be told, I prefer that work of his to this one. This is most likely entirely a matter of personal taste, however; I tend to gravitate towards stories that make the seemingly unfamiliar familiar instead of the other way around, and Cosmicomics’s main aim of making alien beings and concepts surprisingly humanlike and empathetic thus holds more inherent appeal to me than Invisible Cities’s aim of transforming the seemingly mundane and definable city into something vast and difficult to fully grasp. I would not be surprised if the reverse is true for other readers and they thus prefer Invisible Cities over Cosmicomics.This is also not to say that I didn’t enjoy Invisible Cities -- I did, a great deal. Calvino does a wondrous job in describing city after city, making so many of them both appealing and disturbing at the same time, and reflecting so many elements of human nature in them that it ultimately doesn’t truly matter if they’re only imaginary. There is a city built by men who shared the same dream of chasing a naked woman and wished to build a city where she could not escape them, a city that becomes less itself when it consigns the remains of its original iteration to museums, a city that is at its purest and most honest when its people shit, and so many more to mull over.Calvino does such a good job at making each city into a place you want to travel to and experience yourself, in fact, that it actually became a problem of sorts to me. The book is clearly written to get you into the spirit of wandering and getting lost in place after place, and yet each city is so lovingly detailed that I just couldn’t let myself simply get immersed in them. I had to stay alert and try to memorize each and every one of them, which ultimately led to futility and frustration because there are simply too many cities to keep all of them straight in one’s mind.Which might very well be the point -- just how many places out of the number we’ve visited in our lifetime can we truly remember? -- but to me, it was akin to the experience of having so many delectable dishes laid out before me that I wind up trying to eat too much of them and get a stomachache instead of the warm, sated afterglow I should have gotten. I ended up actually preferring the accounts of Kublai Khan’s interactions with Marco Polo because they felt more grounded and comprehensible than the endless parade of cities both real and unreal. Complaining about the prose and engagement of a work being too good is vastly preferable to complaining about the prose and engagement of a work being not good enough, however, and while Cosmicomics remains my Calvino work of choice, I do not regret having read Invisible Cities at all and it definitely gave me much to ponder on. It is a thoughtful, meditative work on cities and how each and every one of them are wholly unique and share numerous familiar characteristics at the same time, and also about how the best travelers and storytellers like Marco Polo can find endless stories to spin out of a single memory or the grains in the wood of a chessboard, and if it didn’t quite resonate with me the way Cosmicomics did, that’s akin to saying that Goodfellas isn’t quite as good as The Godfather and it still gets a definite recommendation from me.",2015-02-28 07:50:57,4,en,2015-02-28 07:50:57,2,2015,0.00895,0.0002,0.00224,0.00021,0.0007,0.00026,616
Keith,"I loved reading Invisible Cities. If the first goal of literature—as I believe it is—is to entertain, this book achieved that goal. On every page, I found entertaining imagery and ideas. But it’s also a book of ideas and themes. Parables and fables, yes, but taken together, they represent the world that we all know.

Dallin Coons,"The word that comes to mind is ‘disjointed’ and that’s probably why I’m not in love with the book. I like the premise of a book elucidating of fantastical cities, and there was cleverness in the social commentary which is definitely my thing. But the lack of cohesive narrative and a sense that these were a bunch of stories written independently and thrown together, plus a little too much fantasy for my tastes, means I wouldn’t put it in my list of ‘greats’, although it certainly is unique and good bedtime reading.",2021-06-03 11:31:41,3,en,2021-06-03 11:31:41,6,2021,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00017,0.00014,92
Sam Duffy,"What is a city? What distinguishes it from the cities that border it, its rivals, and others far away? The people of each city are different. Certainly, the architecture and culture will vary. But that’s not all.We can describe a city in countless ways. When telling you of San Francisco, I could describe it by its weather, the cool breeze and gusty days. I could explain the cold weather as depressing, or as a pocket of cool air amidst the hotter inland California. Or, forgetting the weather, I could tell you of the wonders of the city, or of its horrors.San Francisco still has scars from the massive 1906 earthquake, which resulted in reconstruction and new buildings. There are fresh horrors forming every day through its homelessness crisis and gentrification. Culture is being made and killed, yet I can frame it to suit my needs.Each way of describing the city is true, yet each is unique and suggests its own version of the city.Italo Calvino spends the length of Invisible Cities thinking through the implications of this. The narrative unfolds through the guise of Marco Polo telling the emperor of China, Kublai Khan, of the many cities he sees throughout his travels. Each city is unique and fantastical. Yet Polo says, after telling him of many cities, “Every time I describe a city, I am saying something about Venice.”The book spans fifty-five short stories, each somewhere between an essay and a poem. One, a favorite of mine, discusses how a city’s history is left imprinted on it. The shells left in walls from the war, for instance, telling of the conflict that played out in the city’s streets.“As this wave from memories flows in, the city soaks it up like a sponge and expands. A description of Zaira as it is today should contain all Zaira’s past.” - From Cities and Memory 3This is a very contemporary idea for a book first published in 1972. Today in America, we are coming to terms with our country’s past atrocities, especially racial injustices—which many do not wish to confront. Calvino makes the excellent point that what happens in a place leaves scars and imprints.You can only see one part of a country by looking at its present state, just as you miss context if you ignore its progress.Another of Polo’s descriptions touches on the relationships built in a city named Ersilia. The citizens represent their relationships literally, with strings tied from house to house to symbolize their connection. Friends with friends, lovers with lovers, shopkeepers with their shoppers. They make each connection and relationship clear. As the city runs out of space for the strings, they move to another, beginning the cycle over again.But, as the walls crumble and cities fall, the strings remain. Even after we are gone, our ties to others remain.Each tale is split into eleven categories, each with five stories, and all are brief at one or two pages. Every city is ripe for interpretation, and beautiful to read aloud. They feel like bite-sized musings of Calvino, given narrative cohesion and placement.Invisible Cities is as unique as it is wonderful. Calvino offers his own interpretations of what makes a city, offers universal truths, and leaves room for your own thoughts and interpretations.It is a book that can you can read in just over an hour, returned to repeatedly, like a book of poetry.This is adapted from my article originally published on Medium.",2021-07-06 03:05:46,5,en,2021-07-06 03:05:46,7,2021,0.00083,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00016,574

Moody,"On its surface, Marco Polo recalls for the Emperor Kublai Kahn tales from the empire’s many cities, encountered during his travels. Each city is given its own short and separate description, detailed and unique, but there is something ethereal in the telling. They are mirage-like; the hazy dream of a city that has been remembered more in the image of the storyteller than the place iteself. This was the travel guide I should have read upon coming to my new city. More poetry than the clever fiction I expected, the book was sonorous; at times however, it could come off frustratingly cryptic. Nevertheless, it had an unanticipated impact. It stirred my imagination. My vision of the city around me was changed.“Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvelous invention like Invisible Cities, perfectly irrelevant.” So it’s stamped on the back cover, this from Gore Vidal. Somewhere else on there, Italo Calvino is described as ‘one of the world’s best fabulists,’ and I thought, “Well I guess he is pretty fabulous.” Then I remembered that in my final semester of Italian, I was obligated to translate, and therefore read, Marcovaldo into an awful salad of ugly English (C+, That’s Right!). It was a bright and witty collection of urban fables, and thus (cue big light bulb), Calvino is a renowned writer of fables rather than a renowned uomo of fabulousness. Still, I wish my epitaph could read, “Here lies the world’s greatest Fabulist. He was so awesome, we had to invent a new word.”Remember when you took that photography class and suddenly all the world was suddenly viewed through the lens of a 35mm camera, real or phantom. Could this or that be good picture? And so on. Really, who has the time or the energy or the naiveté to go around trying to imagine a blanket of magic or mystery on the world? It’s all the same thing, over and over again, and repeat the pattern, but this time darker. So, quite unintentionally, I began to manifest bits of fable into my life and into my new town (normally I wouldn’t bother). The story shifted my perception, took me out of myself and the hard boxes of my conviction and rationality, and permitted me the rare luxury of discovering something new and pleasant. I imagine the experience resembles that of some youth reading Harry Potter for the first time.By way of example, a few days ago I was riding home from the other side of town, trying to beat the sunset and the subsequent temperature drop. Three miles south along the river before turning west and the labored ascent into the hills; at the top, breathing hard, I stopped to rest. Looking east, Mt. Hood’s white, western face was lit up orange, a solid mask of snow and glaciers basking against the horizontal sun. A long column of choppy clouds held steady in the western sky, a blanket of upturned rough sea, white capped points that began in a dense matte of inferno orange at the horizon, and terminated along a tangle of soft pink crests straight overhead. Its long, clean border cut the sky in half, leaving me on its inverted shore, imagining ships made of fire, up there sailing that tide, trying to reach the mountain. And that was to story of my city for the day.",2008-06-10 10:39:22,4,en,2008-06-10 10:39:22,6,2008,0.00109,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,571
Evelyn Puerto,"If you are looking for a novel that goes something like Hero has a problem made worse by the villain and they have conflict and stuff happens leading to a climax and mostly everything is resolved in the end, then Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino is not for you.But if you are looking for a different kind of book, then Invisible Cities is worth a try.The story (if you can call it that) centers on Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan of the cities he has seen on his travels. As the novel progresses, it’s not clear whether Marco Polo actually saw the cities, if he’s making it all up, or even if Kublai Khan believes any of what he’s hearing or not. Marco Polo describes fantastic cities, painting a vivid portrait in just a page or two. One sits on stilts, one’s boundaries are ever-shifting boundaries, one is simply pipes and plumbing with no walls or roofs. Another is described as a carpet with twisting patterns which are really a map of the city. Everyone sees it differently, depending on what twists of fate have come into their lives. Following that theme, another city is built on a dream of chasing a woman through a town, another uses the stars as its blueprint.What makes this book so enjoyable is the sheer gorgeousness of the writing. The descriptions of the cities are almost like prose poems. There is lush detail (“the river green with crocodiles”), or this sentence:“And yet, in Raissa, at every moment there is a child in a window who laughs at seeing a dog that has jumped on a shed to bite into a piece of polenta dropped by a stonemason who has shouted from the top of the scaffolding, “Darling, let me dip into it,” to a young serving maid who holds up a dish of ragout under the pergola, happy to serve it to the umbrella-maker who is celebrating a successful transaction, a white lace parasol bought to display at the races by a great lady in love with an officer who has smiled at her taking the last jump, happy man, and still happier his horse, flying over the obstacles, seeing a francolin flying in the sky, happy bird freed from its cage by a painter happy at being painted it feather by feather, speckled with red and yellow …”Another memorable city waged war on fleas and termites, and various species of mutant rats, not suspecting that it was threatened by monsters: sphinxes, griffons, dragons, basilisks and more, all seeking to possess the city. This brought to my mind the image of our own society, obsessed with trivia, ignoring the real issues that threaten our way of life.This, I think, is the key to the book: the images it creates in our minds. Invisible Cities isn’t a quick read, but one to be savored. I admit, there were some passages I read three or four times and still didn’t get. Others were so vivid, like the one quoted above, I could see the crowds in the streets, individuals living their lives, acting and reacting to each other. This is a book that invites you to read between the lines and form your own images.Calvino’s intent may have been summarized by Marco Polo. “‘I speak and speak,’ Marco says, ‘but the listener retains only the words he is expecting…It is not the voice that commands the story, it is the ear.’”",2013-07-06 04:51:13,5,en,2013-07-06 04:51:13,7,2013,0.00205,0.0001,0.00022,0.00011,0.00024,0.00018,575
Bill,"In Invisible Cities, Calvino imagines conversations between Marco Polo, world traveller, and Kublai Khan in his palace at the centre of a vast empire in which Polo describes cities which Kublai may never see. Calvino gave the book it's unique structure by following a small set of simple rules to determine the type of city and theme of each short chapter, combined in different ways to arrive at different permutations. Calvino's genius is in making this much more than a potentially tedious academic exercise or obscure avant garde experiment and making it a beautiful, profound and enthralling piece of literature. One would think that a list of descriptions of cities according to a recombination of a small set of rules would quickly exhaust it's potential but not in Calvino's hands. With measured brevity, Calvino gives these vignettes a surreal beauty and a sense of the metaphysical, offering philosophical speculations and aesthetic pleasures while steadily and subtly deepening the characters and the relationship of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. It is a principle closely related to the Oulipo movement, to which Calvino belonged, that the constraints of form, in contrast to absolute freedom, are often productive of the most inventive works. Invisible Cities is an ideal demonstration of this and is one of the masterpieces of the Oulipo movement, and Calvino's ouvre.",2017-02-22 12:58:34,5,en,2017-02-22 12:58:34,2,2017,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,221

Russell Jaffe,"Invisible Cities is so unbelievably fun and creative it sent me into a creative writing binge and longing for collaboration I am still enraptured by; I have listened to the 2.5 hour audiobook twice, and will likely return again soon. What a great take on what a novel can be! Sometimes I think being wildly creative and sharing those creative visions is the height of what human beings can spiritually achieve. A fantastic book.

Guy,"This book is impossible to review.It isn't prose, it isn't poetry, it isn't history, it isn't a novel, it isn't a narrative.It is festooned, this small book, with yellow sticky notes of the interesting bits, of the beautiful bits, of the energizing bits.It is imagination.This is imagination on a multiplicity of levels and layers. Imagine, if you can, Marco Polo and Genghis Khan talking about Polo's travel experiences. Then imagine Polo describing the wonders of the things he's seen. Then imagine that Polo has imagined more cities than he's seen, filled them with magical constructs, and eccentric citizenry, architecture, social mores.It is, perhaps, most like a travel journal, or log, but like none you could have imagined. Polo, or perhaps Khan's biographers, have catalogued the invisible cities as belonging to distinct classifications.MemoryDesireSignsThin  and several more. Then comes a short description of the city that purports to provide the rationale for the city having been classified as it was.These descriptions are collected into sets, separated by the narrator's observation of the meeting and conversations between Khan and Polo.The writing is brilliant. Calvino's imagination appears to be unbounded and endless.From one of the festooning stickies, picked randomly:...But with all this, I would not be telling you the city's true essence; for while the description of Anastasia awakens desires one at a time only to force you to stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia one morning your desires waken all at once and surround you. The city appears to you as a whole where no desire is lost and all of which you are a part, and since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing but inhabit this desire and be content. Such is the power, sometimes called malignant, sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous city, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labour which gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave (from Cities and Desire 2).And from one the Khan/Polo ruminations: ...As time went by, words began to replace objects and gestures in Marco's tales: first exclamations, isolated nouns, dry verbs, then phrases, rarified and leafy discourses, metaphors and tropes. The foreigner had learned to speak the emperor's language or the emperor to understand the language of the foreigner.But you would have said communication between them was less happy than in the past: to be sure, words were more useful than objects and gestures in listing the most important things of every province and city — monuments, markets, costumes, fauna and flora — and yet when Polo began to talk about how life must be in those places, day after day, evening after evening, words failed him, and little by little, he went back to relying on gestures, grimaces, glances (from after Trading Cities 1).This is a startling and amazing read.",2013-08-04 14:11:16,5,en,2013-08-04 14:11:16,8,2013,0.00179,0.0001,0.00019,0.00011,0.00022,0.00017,494
Jo Castle,"This book piqued my interest because I also enjoyed Calvino's If On A Winter's Night a Traveler- I think my general relationship with Calvino's writing must be that I struggle to get into it and then, after a break and a bit of hard thinking, get back into it, at which point escape is futile and I'm embroiled. I actually got it as a birthday present for my dad, but he admitted defeat a week or so later and handed it back to me. Unless you're addressing a big fan of avant-garde literature it's probably wise to learn from my mistake and not gift this. It's not really a casual read- don't let the short length deceive you. It's only short because the content you get from it is extremely concentrated within the relatively average amount of pages you get. This is not one of those books with which you can risk distraction; I had to read it in bursts.However, this isn't because the whole thing is dripping with plot. In fact, what 'plot' there is- the discussion between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan is an even smaller fraction of the book. The main body is within the descriptions of the many eponymous cities Polo has visited on his travels, and these are where the book really shines. The twist in the 'plot' is that these cities are all some form of Venice- had I not gone into the book expecting this thanks to the blurb on the Vintage Classics edition telling me that, I wouldn't have suspected this at all, since Calvino's descriptions are all so rich and imaginative and at points so delightfully existential that this didn't align with my paltry knowledge of the city of Venice at all. (i.e. it's in Italy, it has some canals in it) I firmly believe that this book could appeal to any and every taste, so long as the reader met all the prerequisites I described. I'm someone who primarily enjoys psychological literature- the sort that focuses heavily on character and the mind, and the webs that these weave- and this book still delighted me despite there being only two characters with names. Though the cities are really the meat of this book, Calvino doesn't skimp on Marco Polo and Kublai Khan- within their various brief interludes an interesting dynamic unfolds between merchant and emperor. You won't want to skip those sections, no matter how insignificant they might seem. More than anything, this book entranced me to think about cities, which I suppose is the general point. Most of us living disenchanted urban lives (me included) probably wouldn't think of cities as much more than skyscrapers and concrete, but Calvino's cities have a perfect mundane sort of magic to them- each one is an elaborate mechanism, bearing traditions and beliefs, vastly different from the others even when they have a section of the book in common (Cities and the Dead, Hidden Cities, etcetera). The fantastical cities that dwell in skies and among stars bear common human hubris; the cities on dry land seem haunting and ethereal. I don't think this book needs any more concrete plot than it has- these cities within themselves are short stories. I just counted, and there are 55 of them.

Micha,"This was the book which did not want to be found. For nearly a year I kept my eyes peeled for it, casually at first, vigorously for the last five months of that time. I went to used bookshops looking only for this novel, I tried new bookstores and was ready to pay those extra pennies for it, in cities and small towns in British Columbia and Ontario, but I could never find it. When I got an e-reader for travelling (and thought how I'd better travel with this one) I searched online but could not find anywhere to buy a digital copy. It was such an infuriating thing, and I will still buy a physical version of this book if it ever comes into existence again because I had to get it onto my e-reader using alternate means.I first heard about this book back when I was in that Medieval Spatial Theory class where I was reading that dry and heavy tome, The Production of Space, interspersed with Middle English poetry. Marco Polo's The Travels was a text for the class and Italo Calvino's name came up quite naturally as it bridged the theory and the literary. What are cities and what do they mean? Is a city the same from one moment to the next because it maintains a name and a mostly-fixed geographical location, or does it constantly change to become a different city? How do each of us know cities differently, and can we call it the same place when there are such differences in what it means to us? All those kinds of questions are raised in this book and made it constantly interesting. Calvino writes beautifully and the way his ideas take shape really pulls at me.The faults I found were two: that I had a digital copy which diminished the aesthetic of the book and did, I think, affect how it is meant to be read (for which I do not fault Calvino, of course), and that I'm not very fond of the cities-as-women/women-as-utopias that pervades it. Calvino really Gazes at women, and I found the same thing in If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. He is constantly reading women but it doesn't seem like he ever listens to them. He is always the authority/author who can interpret them better than they could themselves or even enhance them by the poetry of his evaluations. They seem so aesthetic in his novels and I can't see eye-to-eye with him on that. Whenever he writes about women I wish he'd just stop, really. So while he's got women that are characters and frustrating, there's also the fact that all these cities have female names and I would have liked the book better if it were possible to ignore the fact.",2013-11-07 05:30:50,4,en,2013-11-07 05:30:50,11,2013,0.00089,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,466
Faryal Siddiqui,"Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities might be labelled a travelogue. It was, in fact, the traveller in me that first fell under its spell. Though, the places Calvino describes don't exist on any map. Technically, this is a novel, a work of fiction, but one without any storyline. It consists of a sequence of imaginary dialogues between a young Venetian traveller Marco Polo and an aging Tartar emperor Kublai Khan, where neither of them understand one another's language at all, but come to understand each other through the colour of Polo's imagination. In the course of these discussions, the young Polo describes a series of metropolises he has seen journeying to the far reaches of Khan’s vast empire. Each short chapter describes a different city, 55 in all arranged in 11 groups.""Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions, but the emperor of the Tartars does continue listening to the young Venetian with greater attention and curiosity than he shows any other messenger or explorer of his."" So begins Italo Calvino's compilation of disconnected urban images. Marco tells the Khan about Hypatia, a city of beautiful blue lagoons but where ""crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks""; Armilla, which ""has nothing that makes it seem a city, except the water pipes that rise vertically where the houses should be and spread out horizontally where the floors should be""; the spider-web city of Octavia, whose residents live suspended over an abyss, supported by a net they know won't last long; and other marvellous cities. It may be that he is creating them all out of his imagination, or perhaps he is recreating details of his native Venice over and over again, or perhaps he is simply recounting some of the countless possible forms a city might take.At some point, you realize that Calvino is not talking about cities at all, not in the way we normally think of the word. His cities, like all cities, are constructed not of steel and concrete but of ideas. Each city represents a thought, experiment, an expression of some deeper sentiment or, as Polo tells Khan at one point, ""You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.""This is a slim book, but not the kind you devour in one sitting. I find myself pausing every two or three pages to process what I have just read, not because Calvino's writing is difficult to penetrate, but simply because he packs so much into each sentence; there is so much there. It is best, I think, to read Invisible Cities like a traveller - slowly, luxuriously, as if you have all the time in the world.One of the cities described in the book ends with a warning, “You leave Tamara without having discovered it”; so it is with Invisible Cities. This is precisely what keeps drawing you back to this strange and wonderful book.",2013-12-14 20:40:20,5,en,2013-12-14 20:40:20,12,2013,0.0008,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,507
mobydickens,"POLO: ...Perhaps the terraces of this garden overlook only the lake of our mind...KUBLAI: Just how high are you??POLO: Perhaps all those people... dishwashers, whores, painters, mother's with babes on their tits, exist only because we think of them.KUBLAI: Lark man, I never think of them.POLO: Then they do not exist. Or, perhaps they exist and we do not.KUBLAI: You mean, if we were here we would not be??POLO: Precisely. And here, in fact, we are.KUBLAI: I think the garden is spinning. Or perhaps it is me. Do I look to be rotating at all, young traveler?Forgive me making fun. This book is difficult, but absolutely beautiful. Translated from it's original Italian, it is not a book with a direct plot or face paced adventure; rather it is descriptions of cities, or perhaps a city. Kublai Khan sits in a garden with so called adventurer Marco Polo, and they talk of his travels. But they speak different languages, and they have to speak through gestures and expressions, or more often simply silence.KUBLAI: I don't know what he is doing, my wise servant. The gestures and grimaces are almost too much to bear. What do you suppose it means?SERVANT: I do believe he is saying that the city is round like a goose egg and pimply like a woman's cold buttocks.POLO: I'm going to interrupt you, or at least imagine I am interrupting you to say that futures not achieved are only branches of the past. Eh, dead branches, at that. Also, jetting pulleys and cone-roofed belvederes. I imagine, anyway.KUBLAI: Truly this man is a marvel, if what I imagine him saying he is truly saying. Bring us the chessboard. I do believe we can construct city replicas with it.SERVANT: As you wish, greatest majesty.POLO: Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city can exist.The person who recommended this book to me is one of those people who aren't exactly what you'd expect. He dresses in ratty clothes, has his hair shaved up the sides, I'm not sure what the term for his look is. Grunge maybe. He listens to screamo, goes to loud shows... kind of is completely opposite from me. Yet inside that rougher exterior he is very introspective. I think part of it has to do with him living so much in his art, but he reads and he writes, with really good taste in writing.

There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""",2016-01-27 05:58:07,5,en,2016-01-27 05:58:07,1,2016,0.04194,0.0003,0.00581,0.00034,0.00359,0.00112,519
Amélia Pinto,"This book revolves around two historical characters, Marco Polo, a merchant from Venice, and Kublai Khan, the emperor of Mongolia. In the book, Marco Polo describes the imaginary cities he visited to Kahn, exploring both his and the reader's imagination. The cultural differences between the merchant and the emperor are addressed and expressed especially in the way they view and interpret the world and the simultaneous and apparently contradictory similarity between both in the way they feel attracted by the pleasure of imagining. Despite the book's great philosophical input, I wasn´t personally able to understand all of it, having used the internet and online reviews to understand it more deeply.

Josip Brecak,"I would have to say I have never read such an abstract book and fell so in love with it. . His goal is to juxtapose the mental path with the physical path. And through doing so he makes this imaginary cities(the mental path) into something physical. By using words which make it concrete. This little book is PACKED with loads of information and even though it's a book you can read in one session. I recommend to take your time and ponder through each city and the conversations between Khan and Marco Polo. And then re-read it backwards and then forwards again. If you have never read anything by Italo Calvino you might say to yourself ""What the hell is going on…?!?"" So it's good to know some background about the author who was part of the Oulipo Movement which is part of Post-Moderdan Literature. The Oulipo movement was mainly french writers who were mathematicians who used constrained ways of writing. And as you read more of his novels there is essentially no ""beginning, middle, or end.""(In my opinion) Reason being is so that it can trigger ideas and inspiration. Understanding this is important in realizing what Italo Calvino is trying to point out. In the part of the novel he states that, ""It is not the voice that commands the story, but the ear."" This being so Italo Calvino wants the book to be ""author less"". Which then the books has the reader become the author as they're doing the reading. How is it possible though? Because this is a book where a group of people will read the same exact words but have a total different understanding of whats going on because of their own memory, desires or whatever it might be. And that is why Invisible Cities is author less. He is not the one that commands the story, but you're. Understanding this also ties into one of the themes of communication. Where he points out why do we miscommunicate. And if you're intrigued with the other themes such as; Why do we travel? Where do our desires come from and how do they play a role? What is meaning and how does meaning come into place? What are signs and what do they mean? How do we get to know things and understand? And of course theres much more. Now I won't go on to answer the questions because then you would already go in with a preconceived notion of what he's message is(at least my perception of things). So have fun going in with a blank slate and finding and creating some beautiful emblems.(You'll understand what I mean by emblems when you read the book ;) )Of course this is just what I got from the book. It could be entirely wrong or entirely right. Because it is not the voice that commands the story, but the ear. So I guess you can say I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this little masterpiece and feel free to leave a comment from what you got from this book.

Krys,"The structure of Invisible Cities, that of Marco Polo narrating to Kublai Khan about all of the cities he has seen, is almost irrelevant to this book. For example, while most of Polo's descriptions might fit the period in which he existed historically, at other times he describes modern technologies that were centuries ahead of his time. The result gives his narratives a timeless and surreal feeling. Both this ahistorical sense and the the brevity of each section lend to the metaphoric/philosophic nature here.At no more than three pages per city (and most only one page) each of Polo's accounts read more like prose poems rather than short stories. Taken together, they explore and deconstruct what we mean when we say ""city."" As always, Calvino's language serenades the reader, charming with both his lyricism and his insight about how we conceptualize cities and how that conception shapes both who we are and how we interact with the the world. Heady stuff.There are a few perplexing elements to the book though. One will notice for example, that all of the cities bear women's names, and it is hard to ignore the comparison of cities to women (at least in the first half of the book). According to Polo, and thus Calvino, cities (read: women) are unknowable, and thus uncontrollable. There is an implicit threat to this. Polo is both in awe and terror of the cities he describes, always talking about the cities one sees or one knows, but always aware of this other city, a mirror city, that is imperceptible, a city of the dead, or of opposites, of infinite possibility.Another frustration for me was Calvino's dependency on binaries. A city is always this or that, often reducing the complexity of the urban environment into two choices. This may have been a conscious choice on Calvino's part, maybe to depict cities in the way in which many people think (about anything. Humans do love binaries). But even then, the use of such a structure, describing each part of that dichotomy of each city, becomes predictable and, by the end of the book, boring.Fascinating to me were his fear of overpopulation and distaste for urban sprawl and the suburbanization of the world, both themes towards the end of the book. Both Polo's inability to tell where one city ends and where the next begins and his accounts of breathlessly crowded cities evoke a palpable claustrophobia for the reader.Despite my frustrations, Invisible Cities, like all of Calvino's work, is captivating and forces the reader to think about how and why we tell stories in the first place. And unlike so many post-modern metafictional projects, Invisible Cities smooths out all the bumps in that reflection-heavy mode with gorgeous phrasing and imagery, making for a more pleasant if demanding journey.",2008-07-30 01:38:43,4,en,2008-07-30 01:38:43,7,2008,0.00087,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,466
Emma,"Just as I finished this book today, I came across a TIMES article on an ancient temple built in 16th century, in Mexico, resurfaced due to drought conditions which caused water levels to drop, thus revealing the ancient temple which had been submerged since 1960s (the last resurface was in 2002, under similar drought conditions). The first word which came to my mind was, ""civilization"". How was the city in which this temple was built like back then? Was it anything like the 55 cities as told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan in Invisible Cities? *This book has worked its magical spell on many of its readers. I'm glad I had come across it from a NYT article featuring photos from journalists' and their voyages. The concept of Continuous Cities, brought up by Calvino, as mentioned in that NYT article, intrigued me to read Invisible Cities. I'm so glad I had come to know of this very beguiling, charming, magical book. It speaks in a language which is hard to unpack, yet speaks to you in a seductive, alluring way - the enigma of these cities hard to resist, failing to quench a traveller's wanderlust.""Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had; the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.""*The 55 cities were narrated to the reader like a charming tale or maybe even poetry, in metaphors, and are purportedly of cities which Marco Polo had ""travelled"" to. Zaira, ""city of high bastions""; Anastasia, ""a city with concentric canals watering it and kites flying over it""; Sophronia, ""made up of two half-cities""... These cities could be real... or imagined; a mix of existing, non-existing, modernistic, futuristic... cities made up of its people, its morals, its secrets, its desires, its ideas, its contradictions. The word ""travel"" thus becomes figurative; the mind travels and wanders, conjuring and inventing cities. And one wonders its purpose? Perhaps the delight lay in the answer it gives to a question one has.Along the way I felt that the pages had transported me to an ethereal world. I ponder how traveling would be like from now on, as I venture to explore one city after another. How many of the cities that I travel to in the future would contain some form and quality of the cities which Marco Polo had conjured?* Great book to experiment with imagination and thought, yet still giving one ample space to reflect. The cities we travel to interlock with many things that points back to one's inner soul: memories; desires; death; intricate relationships; signs; meaning; names; history; space; place; time...

Chris,"I still can't decide whether this book amazed or angered me as at time there are beautiful passages and ideas but also it dithers and feels like a creative writing exercise. I've settled (for the time being) that I liked it a lot and whilst reading it felt somehow important. Two of the cities that stood out to me were Adelma and Hypatia. Below is a passage from the latter that remained with me after reading.""...... a magnolia garden was reflected in blue lagoon, I walked among the hedges, sure I would discover young and beautiful ladies bathing; but at the bottom of the water, crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks, their hair green with seaweed.""",2017-02-23 21:21:26,4,en,2017-02-23 21:21:26,2,2017,0.00079,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,123

Joana,"Calvino was a delayed surprise. I bought Invisible Cities a long time ago, mostly due to its suggestive title but also its lower price. I had it the bookshelf until some months ago. For some reason I decided that it came the time that I could read it. Such ""time""happens to me a lot, specially with the books. It is an unreasonable fact but I believe that after I devoted myself to buy, I should not rush into it immediately, I think my life chooses the books accordingly with its mood. So here I am, me and the invisible me, after the long ride which Calvino lead us along the book. I was not familiar with type of writing, and now that I'm thinking about it, maybe I haven't been reading for too long or maybe lately, I found too many peculiar ways of writing. Something that I need to think about it. However, Calvino narrative surprised me, I expected a beginning and the first words seemed already that I had caught Polo and Kublai-Kan in the middle of their adventure of being or perhaps not being. I felt an intruder and I was not sure if I could be inside of it, it felt so peculiar their relationship, so intimate. I felt a spectator all the book, not for a second I saw/felt those cities with Polo's heart or the astonishment expressions from Kublai. I was definitely an outsider. It made me reflect a lot about spaces, about the intense discharge of emotions that we we often leave on spaces, physical,transcendental... The beginning sounded extremely descriptive and somehow disconnected from me but as soon as Polo and the Emperor relationship goes into a open dialogue,thus an intimate level, the cities become strangely connected, alive within the others. I felt dragged on the lights, on the many limbos that existed among them. I felt in one city being that one, so many parts of others. In the end I was so touched by the emperor conclusions, by its sudden calm at understanding the true nature of all Polo's stories about cities. Polo was more than a story teller, he was an alive dream of the many wonders that really and surreal existed inside himself. He was an heart all the time, a voyeur, a curious and eager mind. After being dragged by the many reasoning arguments from the emperor, he showed him that it is necessary a heart to achieve clearly the many imperfections and beauty that is constantly surrounding us. It is a book that unravel some obvious facts about life, about your place on life. I felt bigger after the book, richer for being in so many places but for understand that maybe those many places might had been only a single one. I had a really pleasant reading. I would advice it immensely.",2013-05-19 22:55:01,5,en,2013-05-19 22:55:01,5,2013,0.00087,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,476
Phil Miletic,"I have been meaning to read Calvino for a long time now, and this book has always been recommended to me. Because of a class, I finally got to read Invisible Cities and I couldn't put it down. This is a fantastic, beautiful, wonderful book that is absolutely brilliant. As I read through each city, there'd always be a smile on my face. Each city is great, inventive, and interestingly described. The fact that it is a description of ""invisible"" cities may deter some, but it's not just description. At the beginning of some cities, I knew where Calvino was going. But it's how he describes these cities that breathe live into these description. I was always distracted by the book because as I was reading about one city, I was thinking of another. These brief glimpses only spurred my imagination of what else can be found within these cities, what else about these cities, and what other cities can be imagined. And this is part of the purpose of the book: to force readers to see other invisible cities. These cities are both imaginary and real, and for all we know these descriptions could be of one city. There are many possibilities in which a city can be experienced and seen. For example, the one thin city, Isaura, a tall city that is composed of pipes, drains, scaffolding, and water, this city is simply the drainage system skeleton of a city.And the conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan is terrific. At times, they don't even talk, but slip into silence or gestures. Although nothing is said, there is something that can be read in these silences. But the banter between the two enrich and tie up the book. Rather than a list of cities, these cities are being related to Kublai by Marco. With these two characters, you have a conquerer and an explorer. Their relationship is a perpetual one: because of the explorer, the conquerer has more lands he needs to conquer (to know, possess, experience); because of the conquerer, the explorer is pushed out in order to find undiscovered cities, places unknown, etc. Yet, this book doesn't drag; it's quite a short book. As I said, the book is a glimpse of possibilities, a glimpse of only a few cities. This glimpse encourages more cities to be thought of outside of the text; the text gestures outside itself; it gestures towards silence, what was not written. And this is what makes the book magnificent: as you are reading the text, you are also reading the silence of the text. After reading Invisible Cities and time passes by, I wonder if I will unintentionally make up cities that weren't in the book when I relate the book and its cities to someone in conversation.",2014-01-17 07:56:35,5,en,2014-01-17 07:56:35,1,2014,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,467
Jack,"Reminds me of the Alchemist in its brevity and ineffable mysteriousness. Reading this book feels like dreaming an endless dream, entering a landscape where the physics and rules of reality are unfamiliar, but yet retains the texture of truth. Calvino's Marco Polo tells tales of cities from his travels to Kublai Khan in an echo of Arabian nights, and the books shifts from Polo's accounts to conversations between Polo and the Khan. The cities described seem to come out of a Jungian dreamscape of distilled truths of humanity, Despina - the platonic border city, Octavia - precariousness and mortality manifested. Calvino's Polo declares - ""Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else."" The imagery Calvino conjures is striking. Eusapia the city with an upper city and a lower mirrored city of the dead, with skeletons going about their banal business in the earth. However, I was more drawn to the dialogue between Polo and the Khan, conversations that are meditations on tricky ideas of reality, myth, memory, possession, past, future, truth, facsimile. What does it all mean? It is tempting to interpret some concrete thread of coherent meaning, but Calvino warns us:Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind’s phantasms. “On the day when I know all the emblems,” he asked Marco, “shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?” And the Venetian answered: “Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.”",2019-05-06 06:41:15,4,en,2019-05-06 06:41:15,5,2019,0.00099,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,268
Rocco Febbo,"Marco Polo recounts his travels to a reflective Kublai Khan, who is feeling unfulfilled in his crumbling empire. Each page tells the story of a new city, based on a number of a different themes - it is eventually revealed that each city is just a different description of Venice. I really liked the passages between Marco and Kublai, and some of the cities were interesting but overall the writing was WAY too abstract for me to enjoy. I was really intrigued by the concept but it was more poetic than I anticipated and I had no idea what was going on most of the time - probably a little too sophisticated for my small brain!",2022-05-04 19:53:09,2,en,2022-05-04 19:53:09,5,2022,0.00223,9e-05,0.00023,0.0001,0.00026,0.00016,116
Molly,"""And I hear from your voice"" says Kublai Khan to Marco Polo "" the invisible reasons which make cities live, through which perhaps, once dead, they may come back to life.Reading Invisible Cities is to be awake and dreaming at the same time. It is an entrancing exercise in thought, in memory, to build the cities that are described within the pages. Each section reveals a new wonder, a taste of city you will never see, and yet, in a short time will become deeply acquainted with.If you are wondering how this might leave from for a story, the plain answer is: it doesn't. There is no linear narrative to be followed. Your main characters, if you would call them such, appear once a chapter and always in the same place. They aren't protagonists or antagonists so much as they are guides, leading you through the philosophical exercise of reading Invisible Cities.This lack of linearity is not something I mind. In many ways Invisible Cities is a refreshing break from the hundreds of novels that populate the 1001 list. Instead of focusing on characters or storyline, you focus on place. Each city you build in your head strings onto a chain of understanding as though it were a pearl. Luminous in its own right, together the entire group of them make a work far surpassing its individual parts. To read Invisible Cities is to have the world spread out before you, as limitless and exciting as it was when you first began to explore it as a youth.Not only do the cities all form a great tapestry of a world, but there are threads of meaning that stretch between several of the entries. It's worth reading Invisible Cities at least twice. Once to read from beginning to end, and the second time to read each of the groupings (""cities and names"", ""thin cities"") as a whole. Rearranging these certain elements reveals the deeper meanings to some of the entries, strange but piercing musings on the nature of all cities, real and imagined.Invisible Cities has long been one of my favorite books. Reading it recharges my brain, revitalizing creative battery cells that feel tapped out. It's like taking a vacation to the most interesting places you could ever imagine. Not only are you immersed in a beautiful world, pushing the brain to build such things leaves it feeling renewed with potential. It was just as much a treat to read again as it was the first time, and I predict that this time will likely not be the last either.Liked this review?

Jessie (Zombie_likes_cake),"Every so often, when I read certain classics or very sophisticated writings and then look at all the positive reviews on goodreads, I am a bit stunned. Especially when a lot (not all of them to be fair but a decent amount) say something along the lines that they didn't quite get it but liked it anyway, then I get the feeling no one dares to admit their dislike since it is such a smart and acclaimed book and criticizing it would likely not say anything about the book but about one's own smartness, right? Well, I am going to say it anyway, I didn't like ""Invisible Cities"" and I am surely surprised it is so well received. It seems like it should have a smaller happy audience with its difficult structure, you have to see, there is no ordinary plot or narrative, all the reader gets is a string of city descriptions, mostly not longer than a page or two intercepted with very short paragraphs (again, mostly a page or two) of the actual conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan who makes MP tell him about the cities in his empire he hasn't seen himself. Soon it becomes clear that these city descriptions are not really about cities, though they are about that, too. But they might about one single city, they have made up women's names, they are about people and how they live, interact and die, they are about ideas, concepts, they are little philosophical constructs. The lose narration gave me the hardest time, it made me literally sleepy every time I picked this book up and started reading. The tiny city chapters are so short that before I could go and dive into the presented idea it was over, and by reading on and on, they blended, became elusive, and to put it bluntly, I hardly cared after a very short while. This might be the right book for someone who loves exploring ideas and concepts; like reading one chapter than thinking through the presented aspects, if that sounds like something you might enjoy, this is your book. Frankly, in parts I found the meanings behind the cities pretentious, in parts I didn't get them (simple as that), in very few parts my interest was sparked for a moment but a moment only, in more parts they were dull and fleeting.  So, no it was not my book. Maybe it's yours. But maybe you will only pretend to like it to sound smart and sophisticated (who knows, maybe that's why I gave 2 instead of only 1 star?), maybe you are really lucky and actually are smart and sophisticated and honestly enjoy it. Me, I will go and read a dumb book next, then tear that apart in a review so I can feel smart again.",2014-01-17 21:30:07,2,en,2014-01-17 21:30:07,1,2014,0.00072,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,472
Holly,"Beautiful and inexplicable, I felt I needed a decoder to understand this book and found that if I just let go of the search for meaning, I could enjoy the beauty, strangeness, fantasy of the different cities. The book's structure or backbone is the great, aging Kublai Khan's discussions w/ the young adventurer Marco Polo. Khan wonders at his empire, ""which had seemed to [him] the sum of all wonders"" but is in fact ""an endless, formless ruin, that corruption's gangrene has spread."" He's trying to understand why, to find a form, to figure out why he feels this way when he clearly has so much. Marco Polo tells Kahn stories of the cities he has visited, and they are magical. They are sad and happy. Calvino has grouped the cities according to themes: cities and memories, cities and desire, cities and signs, thin cities, etc.This is the sort of book that readers often dislike but critics love.Themes:--Cities (and people and memories) are inherently transitory. If a city is one thing in our memories and another thing in actuality, what are we to do with that? If a city is one thing one day and something else the next day, what are we to do with that?--Cities and people are intertwined; without the people, the city wouldn't exist; the people give the city form. Therefore in discussing the city, he inherently also discusses the people. One of the sad discussions is about whether all cities (and thus all people) are becoming the same; by putting them on a map, by using geography one creates differences; but I feel Marco Polo's cities (and real, visible cities) are very different.--The cities are all named after women; one theory for why boats are named after women is that it started with languages with genered nouns, and the gender for ""city"" in German is female: ""die Stadt""; the same is true in French: ""la ville"" is ""the city""; la is feminine--The title of the book is invisible cities, not imaginary cities--Venice - Marco Polo states, ""Every time I describe a city, I am saying something about Venice.""--Many critics love to look for symmetry - they find the center most chapter and look for meaning there; they find the very middle page of the book and look for meaning there; or they find the very first and very last page and look there. In the very middle of the book is the city Baucis, named after a myth in Ovid where only two citizens of a city treat the disguised gods of Zeus and Hermes as guests; they are rewarded w/ their life; their fellow citizens die in a flood but their house is turned into a temple.",2014-08-27 09:03:34,3,en,2014-08-27 09:03:34,8,2014,0.00072,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,453
Sumit,"""Those who look down from the heights conjecture about what is happening in the city; theywonder if it would be pleasant or unpleasant to be in Irene that evening. Not that they have anyintention of going there (in any case the roads winding down to the valley are bad), but Irene isa magnet for the eyes and thoughts of those who stay up above.At this point Kublai Khan expects Marco to speak of Irene as it is seen from within. But Marcocannot do this: he has not succeeded in discovering which is the city that those of the plateaucall Irene. For that matter, it is of slight importance: if you saw it, standing in its midst, it wouldbe a different city; Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes.For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who aretrapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there isanother city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I havealready spoken of Irene under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Irene.""Replace Irene with Love and you we have the most accurate picture of nature of love that can be drawn. Love in its elusive yet attractive form, something that we all craved for, some reached its shore while others are destined to roam waters of infinity in its search, and yet another group is avoiding it to maintain the frozen state of heart they have achieved through years of practice and are scared what if the warmth of a careless smile might thaw it and release them again in the wilderness of love's emotional forest.Author has written poetry, I have been to many cities myself and while reading the accounts of his cities, I was reminded of many of them. I once again saw them from new angles and realized that how wrong my impression of them was. Ever changing nature of our life and the groups that we create is depicted in most beautiful way. Imagining about what was once here, and what will come can only give us any sort of indication about nature of current state that is existing as of today, but than again as this moment is gone so is the image that we drew. Our attempts of drawing sketches is akin to drawing on the sands on the beach only to see it being swept clean by next wave. And as sea which never stops and keep on providing us a new drawing board so are our attempts to measure and define shape of things which are by nature fickle. The only thing constant is change and one must learn to enjoy it.",2014-09-04 13:54:23,5,en,2014-09-04 13:54:23,9,2014,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,470
Abeer Hoque,"Sometimes you aren't ready to read a book. My sister recommended Italo Calvino to me more than 10 years ago. My writing advisor a few years after that. I picked up ""Invisible Cities"" both times and put it back down again, finding it scattered and confusing. I found it again this week at my parents' place in Pittsburgh and devoured it each night, each dreamscape city building itself in my mind, breaking me down. It's hard to say what the book is about. A conversation between Marco Polo and Kubla Khan at the twilight of his empire? Stories about cities and history? An ode to Venice? A meditation on time and memory and how going afar changes the near? There is this passage: ""... what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the traveler's past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which each day that goes by adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.""Though I can't completely get my head around this passage, I am utterly moved, and delighted. Perhaps I needed to go travelling for years for these words to resonate. Or to become a writer. However, even with such a little book (less than 200 pages) and a lyrical and philosophical writing style, I found the city descriptions slightly repetitive, and some of the conversations as well. But I kept reading, feeling like there were secret messages. Like this wondrous passage, a call to a calling, a purpose in life: ""There are two ways to escape suffering the inferno of the living. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""I'm sure Mr. Calvino had an ordering scheme, or reasons for the categories of cities he chose. I couldn't decipher them, and I'm not sure whether any of that narrative stuff even matters. He is a philosopher, and an artist of the highest order. I highly recommend this book.",2009-10-17 02:47:58,4,en,2009-10-17 02:47:58,10,2009,0.00094,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,434
Krzysztof,"Just before starting a new book, there's a great feeling of possibility. Looking at the title and the cover, the story could be anything - anything until you open it up and read the first page.I'd been wanting to read this book for a couple of years now and, having read Calvino before, I knew the contents of the book really could be anything. The excerpt on the back of the book didn't quite know what to call this (a novel, a poem?). I'd call it a poem. Aiken's ""House of Dust"" came to mind reading it and even the placement of the page numbers look like stanza markers. Short as this work is, it can get a bit repetitive. But there are some great, simple truths in it.A book can be anything before you begin to read it. As if reading my mind, Calvino writes: For a long time Pyrrha to me was a fortified city on the slopes of a bay, with high windows and towers, enclosed like a goblet, with a central square deep as a well, with a well in its center. I had never seen it. It was one of the many cities where I had never arrived, that I had conjured up, through its name: Euphrasia, Odile, Margara, Getullia. Pyrrha had its place among them, different from each of them, and like each of them, unmistakable to the mind's eye. The day came when my travels took me to Pyrrha. As soon as I set foot there, everything I had imagined was forgotten; Pyrrha had become what is Pyrrha; and I thought I had always known that the sea is invisible to the city, hidden behind a dune of the low, rolling coast; that the streets are long and straight; that the houses are clumped at intervals, not high, and they are separated by open lots with stacks of lumber and with sawmills; that the wind stirs the vanes of the water pumps. From that moment on the name of Pyrrha has brought to my mind this view, this light, this buzzing, this air in which a yellowish dust flies: obviously the name means this and could mean nothing but this. My mind goes on containing a great number of cities I have never seen and will never see, names that bear with them a figure or a fragment or a glimmer of an imagined figure: Getullia, Odile, Euphrasia, Margara. The city high above the bay is also there still, with the square enclosing the well, but I can no longer call it by a name, nor remember how I could ever have given it a name that means something entirely different.

EA Solinas,"""Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expeditions, but the emperor of the Tartars does continue listening...""So writes Italo Calvino, in one of the more ethereal experimental books he wrote. While not as weird as a book made up of tarot card adventures, ""Invisible Cities"" is a story that defies easy classification -- it's soft, dreamlike narrative in which one man tells another about the magical cities he's seen. Or, possibly, has not seen.The famous Venetian explorer Marco Polo arrives in the empire of Kublai Khan, and the two men become friends. In the evenings, Marco tells the Khan of many fabulous cities -- the grey metal and stone Fedora, the stilted Zenobia, the haunted moonlit Zobeide, the sensual and bejeweled Anastasia, the cloud-straddling Baucis, the watery Esmeralda, a city of dead people known as Adelma, the dirt-choked Argia, the hazy rose-tinted Irene, and many others.""Invisible Cities"" isn't really a story so much as a series of beautiful pictures-in-prose. It's like we're watching Calvino paint us portraits of his fantasy cities with his words -- and except for Kublai Khan and Marco Polo occasionally conversing about trade, travel or chess, there is no actual plot here. It's just gorgeous portraits of imaginary cities.And therein lies its charm. Calvino came up with dozens of fantastical cities in here. Few if any of them could actually exist, but they are so suffused with sensual beauty (""its villas all of glass like aquariums where the shadows of dancing girls with silvery scales swim..."") and darkness (""All corpses, dried in such a way that the skeleton remains sheathed in yellow skin, are carried down there, to continue their former activities..."") that you don't care.Instead, Calvino comes up with strange, weird and illogical ideas, such as a city with ho actual buildings, but lots of plumbing. There are cities of the dead and the unborn; cities of the sea, the air, the earth and the sunrise; cities where everyone is a stranger and steampunk cities rusted into oblivion. It's like he's opened a hundred doors to eerie other worlds, and let us take a single picture of each before the doors close.""Invisible Cities"" is not a book for people who like plot -- instead, it's a chance to immerse yourself in Italo Calvino's magical language and imagination.",2011-04-30 17:57:42,4,en,2011-04-30 17:57:42,4,2011,0.00092,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00016,393

Gabriel,"A difficult book to review. The truth is I'm not sure how much I'd read of this before, except that it wasn't all; it came up in a work context this fall, though, and I realized I could just pick it up and give it a go start-to-finish this time.I first encountered this book when I was... probably 13 or 14, and don't at all remember how. I got a copy, and one way or another I never got around to it and then misplaced it at some point. It had the cover pictured with the mostly-white and the goldish corner illustration of the fantastical city. The funny thing is, reading it now I've come around to so many of the things it's interested in through other paths. That didn't make it less transporting or beautiful, and I highlighted many parts for inspiration for game or story design and writing; some of the anecdotes really will stick in my head, like Tamara (a city of signs) and Despina (a city with two faces), but I think especially the very succinct and haunting story of Octavia, the spider-web city.Many of the chapters in-between are also lovely and surreal and of course intended as their own fables. I think my emotional response to the whole thing was colored by having played - also now a while ago! - the game Bigger Than You Think, which I recommend, and other melancholy-beautiful, sometimes endless and procedural world-exploring games like Hoist Sail for the Heliopause and Home and Sunless Sea.In closing, this is one of the passages I highlighted:An oracle was questioned about the mysterious bond between two objects as dissimilar as the carpet and the city. One of the two objects--the oracle replied--has the form the gods gave the starry sky and the orbits in which the worlds revolve; the other is an approximate reflection, like every human creation.For some time the augurs had been sure that the carpet's harmonious pattern was of divine origin. The oracle was interpreted in this sense, arousing no controversy.

But maybe not this time, I could have known that reading a combination of those two books could become very dark and heavy at some point. So I went the book store and picked up this Calvino to have something lightweight (literally and figuratively) to accompany me. I first encountered Calvino in the book Second Person Singular. His book Our Ancestors was vaguely mentioned as a book that changed the life of someone the main character knew. I was curious and when I found out that the writer's name sounds like a fairytale I was just determined to read his work. Invisible Cities reads like a train. It was only a few hours since I stepped on that train when I was sitting with my brother at the Rodetorenkaai in Ghent in the sun, reading, when he asks me: 'What is it about?'. I had no idea. I was already over half way and I felt like I had spent the past hours in that train travelling from city to city. And although Calvino was telling me all kinds of things about the cities we passed, it felt more like he was wrapping his dreams and all the ideas he has and was projecting them on fictional places. Maybe all the cities he describes is just one place, with so many layers and people who all see the city in a different way. I couldn't stop reading it. Kind of strange since I had no idea where it was heading, no story to be found in the book. Maybe it was just leading to the final paragraph:The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live everyday, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.I have no idea what happened to me reading this the past days. But I loved it. Is it because of the book or because of all the times my thoughts started straying? I should put this one on my shelf and read it again when I'm older. How much older is not important. It is the idea of this that matters.",2014-05-31 00:45:53,5,en,2014-05-31 00:45:53,5,2014,0.00069,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,450

By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else's present.""

John,"I’m tempted to call this thoroughly unique work a list-novel, but then I think it’s better to call it a collection of OCD urban folktales. Gore Vidal said of it, “Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvelous invention like Invisible Cities, perfectly irrelevant.” Bearing in mind my Sisyphean task, I’ll simply say two things: 1) the basic premise is that the explorer Marco Polo is describing the cities he’s ostensibly visited to the Kublai Khan in the waning days of the latter’s empire, a total of 55 allegorical tales of cities that exist mostly in Polo’s mind, and in all of ours, fragmentary glimpses of cities that any urbanite will recognize in their own2) Calvino arranges the stories with perfect symmetry: 9 sections, each beginning and ending with a conversation between Polo and the Khan and containing either 5 or 10 descriptions of individual cities, and the cities are categorized by topic (Cities and Memory, Cities and Desire, Cities and Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities and Eyes, Cities and Names, Cities and the Dead, Cities and the Sky, Continuous Cities, Hidden Cities), five named cities per topic, and arranged in each section in descending order, e.g., Cities and Memory 5 (Maurilia), Cities and Desire 4 (Fedora), Cities and Signs 3 (Zoe), Thin Cities 2 (Zenoba), Trading Cities 1 (Euphemia). The combination of the individual power of each mythic city and the rhythmic presentation of each in the fabric of the book leads the reader (me, at least) into a dream-like openness to the imagined experience of not only traveling to each city, but seeing each city as merely one facet of a larger City. Polo ostensibly saw his own Venice in each, I see my own New York. At one point in their conversations, the Khan tells Polo, “Your cities do not exist. Perhaps they have never existed. It is sure they will never exist again. Why do you amuse yourself with consolatory fables?” And Polo replies, “This is the aim of my explorations: examining the traces of happiness still to be glimpse, I gauge its short supply. If you want to know how much darkness there is around you, you must sharpen your eyes, peering at the faint lights in the distance.”",2013-08-22 08:08:36,5,en,2013-08-22 08:08:36,8,2013,0.00082,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,387
Saul Rodriguez,"Ítalo Calvino's succinct book, Invisible Cities, tells of the fictional(?) conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo when the Khan's empire is crumbling. As an act of empathy and maybe even pity, Polo recounts hundreds of cities in intricate detail to distract the Khan.At 160-something pages, this book does not overstay its welcome. Yet it achieves such wonderful imagery and dream-like sequences it is hard to believe certain authors spend multiple books creating a world when Calvino can create a tangible city in 2-3 pages. To Calvino, cities are more than a geographical location on a map. They are breathing nexuses of rich history and infinitely interesting customs, smells, textures and languages. Every city described in this book is an experiment in chaos and control. Some prevail and some are just skeletons left behind by civilizations lost. Of course Calvino wears his influences on his sleeve. Most notably Borges and Tolkien, but it never feels like I am reading a distillation of either. Instead, I get the sense that this book is a very personal endeavor into Calvino's memory of places he grew up in or visited. The pages breathe as he describes each city and its citizens with detailed language that often times you want to reach for an Atlas and find these cities. And there is the conversations between the Khan and Polo, which were my personal favorites. These two very real characters that actually met in real life trading philosophies make for profound passages. The Khan continually doubts Polo's stories, dismissing them as too fantastic, but ultimately is engrossed by them. This book ultimately does serve a deeper message beyond beautiful descriptions of cities. And that is just how much we truly shape our environment. The buildings and fauna and weather ultimately do not make the city, it is us, the people. The citizens make the city what it is and what it will be known as in history books. Therefore, Calvino urges us to push beyond the normalcy and monotony of the banal and search for a way to individually shape our cities.",2017-02-04 15:23:51,5,en,2017-02-04 15:23:51,2,2017,0.00077,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00016,347
Dougie,"I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. A description of it makes it sound, frankly, ludicrous. Kublai Khan and Marco Polo sit on the steps of Xanadu and discuss the various cities Marco has visited, all of them invented and mostly fantastical, with various women's names. The cities are split into eleven categories, five in each, and the descriptions serve as a sort of meditation on each of the categories.The book covers things like how we live together, people, communities, societies, as well as more personal and introspective musings like how we think and feel and perceive the world - all through the various odd and impossible cities described. The ones which stood out most for me were Eutropia, where there are many cities but only one is inhabited at a time but, ""On the day when Eutropia's inhabitants feel the grip of weariness and no one can bear any longer his job, his relatives, his house and his life, debts, the people he must greet or who greet him, then the whole citizenry decides to move to the next city, which is there waiting for them, empty and good as new; there each will take up a new job, a different wife, will see another landscape on opening his window, and will spend his time with different pastimes, friends, gossip."", and Ersilia, where the connections between family, friends, businesses, traders and so on are represented by coloured strings stretched from poles at the corners of the houses of the connected people. These build up until the people can no longer move freely about the city, at which point everything except the strings is torn down and moved to a new site, from where they can see the patterns of strings.The dialogues between Khan and Polo as well muse on various things, covering existentialism, the nature of memory and perception and all in a fantastically lyrical style. The whole book is written in a poetic language that is highly evocative and hard not to lose yourself entirely in.It's really incredible and I can't properly describe it all here, The book is huge in scope and covers so much but is also incredibly short. You should read it, everyone should read it. Read it twice, I did, and it's even better the second time.",2019-06-03 19:41:19,5,en,2019-06-03 19:41:19,6,2019,0.00092,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,386

Andrew,"I thought I would have liked this more than I did. I like most of Calvino’s books, and in this one the writing is absolutely beautiful, the observations on cities are clever and insightful, and the structure is innovative. But somehow, for me, all of these ingredients didn’t add up to a very rewarding whole.I think the problem was the lack of plot. The structure of the book is a series of one- or two-page descriptions of different imaginary cities, with occasional philosophical conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in between. Nothing happens, there is no progress, and nothing much is revealed about the characters. It’s all a long intellectual game. The flights of fancy were certainly very impressive, but I kept finding that my mind was wandering as I read, and I had to go back and start at the top of the page, something that has rarely happened to me since the days of prescribed reading at school and university.I was reading quite late at night mostly, so maybe that was the problem, but again that is not normally an issue for me. If I like a book, I can concentrate on it even when I am dog tired. This one just failed to hold my interest, as much as I loved the premise, the writing and the ideas. The cities, as different as they were, just began to sound the same, and the descriptions became repetitive.I guess Calvino’s point was to describe general attributes of the city by describing different specific cities that embody an aspect of it in the extreme – for example in Leonia people refashion their lives every day, throwing everything out and using new clothes, fresh sheets, etc. “So you begin to wonder if Leonia’s true passion is really, as they say, the enjoyment of new and different things, and not, instead, the joy of expelling, discarding, cleansing itself of a recurrent impurity.” This is a great insight, beautifully expressed, and the book is full of things like this. But there are no real people doing things.I suppose this book made me realise that while experimentation is great, and beauty and cleverness go a long way, the more prosaic basics like plot and character do go a long way.",2010-03-23 23:41:42,3,en,2010-03-23 23:41:42,3,2010,0.00065,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,377
Meera Nair,"Italo Calvino enthralls his audience by spinning vivid descriptions of “invisible” cities. He uses the medium of culture, narration and imagination to convey the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan being the mighty emperor demands that Marco Polo account his journeys around the world. What transpires after, is a treat to one’s mind. For Marco Polo speaks of Cities &amp; Desires, Hidden Cities, Cities of the Dead and various such notions, categorically emphasizing the key aspects of different cities he has been to.I wanted to like this book so much so that I re-read the first few pages over again. Its beautifully written, no doubt. The various cities he names capture your attention and move you to think about the similarities they possess. Many of the cities were magical and several others had a dystopian feel to them. But what didn’t sit well with me is the direction of the narration. Clearly these cities he described were only in his imagination or seemingly gathered from the other places he had been to. Talking about such non-existent cities didn’t serve any obvious purpose. I think I tried too hard to find meaning where there was none or maybe my interpretations were all awry. But I just didn’t get this book. I got the cities, individually, understood what they represented. But were they just for holding Kublai Khan’s attention? Having read chapters of other fictional books, that had a clear cut beginning and end, I found it difficult to process this one. The writing style is different, the form of the book is unique. They are sectioned as Cities &amp; Memory, Cities &amp; Desire etc. The distinction is clear too but for what aim? Was he just pitting different ideas against each other to see how Khan would react? I had more questions than should be, towards the end of the book. Loose threads that didn’t get tied. Perhaps I ought to read up more on the context of this book before I give it another try. Which I am determined to do as almost everyone else has given this book a 5 star rating. I suggest you try it, because its very different from what is usually written.",2015-07-03 22:49:07,2,en,2015-07-03 22:49:07,7,2015,0.00075,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,370

Jonathan,"I must express my bias for Italo Calvino. I personally think he has been one of the most innovative writers of the 20th century. A book like Invisible Cities is like a refreshing glass of lemonade after having mowed your yard. So short, sweet and poignant that I pretty much dog-eared the whole damn book. The book is a series of vignettes about various cities (or one city, or all cities), each vignette displaying a particular dichotomy, whether it be between the living and the dead or the sky and earth. I think the dialogue between Marco Polo (imagination) and Kublai Kahn (perception) is another dichotomy that also helps thread the vignettes together. This book is just so damn beautiful in its subtly that you can only compare it to other Calvino books because I have yet to read another author with such a profound sense of imagery. He creates a wonderful sense of timelessness and placelessness, and always has, especially in his short stories like those of Cosmicomics. I think this is derived for the most part with his fascination with folk and fairy tales. If you are looking for a way to lighten your day, I would recommend either this book, or his other short stories.Excerpt: ""Your cities do not exist. Perhaps they have never existed. It is sure they will never exist again. Why do you amuse yourself with consolatory fables? I know well that my empire is rotting like a corpse in a swamp, whose contagion infects the crows that peck it as well as the bamboo that grows, fertilized by its humors. Why do you not speak to me of this? Why do you lie to the emperor of the Tartars, foreigner?"" Polo knew it was best to fall in with the sovereign's dark mood. ""Yes , the empire is sick, and, what is worse, it is trying to become accustomed to its sores. This is the aim of my exploration: examining the traces of happiness still to be glimpsed, I gauge its short supply.

Ethan Miller,"Invisible Cities is a beautiful little book. I loathe to say ""Dream-like"" because I usually find ""Dream-like"" literature a bit of a drag to read. But Calvino dances so beautifully between prose and poetry, philosophy and fable, macro reality and fantasy. How can we describe a city? We can describe a cities' architecture at any given moment, it's longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, the temperature on a given day, etc. But to describe a cities' ""essence"" or ""soul"" and not just as it stands in it's current moment but as it's whole; that is a mind boggling feat. Truly a feat of astronomical proportions and details. It is literally impossible for us to do because of the vast inherent mysteries in all the uncatalogued details of the masses daily lives let alone the misinterpreted or rewritten histories of it's known events. Of course a city even with all it's unknowns and mysteries is a changing thing in essence even to a single person depending on a moment of romance, danger, boredom, etc. So how do you try to describe a city if you go beyond it's current historical moment and it's obvious and most famous attributes? A truly baffling question. In the same way it is fairly baffling to describe Calvino's book. The closest I can come is to say that he is calmly focused on this great question without being baffled and what he is able to surmise is a basket full of those fleeting little resonant moments when you have the vaguest, most delicate sense of some sort of engagement with human history as a micro element that plays an unsung part in a larger pane of glass.  If you do a lot of traveling for business or pleasure I highly recommend this book. No doubt you have looked out of the airplane window at 30,000 feet, leaned over the railing of the ferry or stared into the growing city horizon through the windshield and pondered that place in a flood of myths, memories and imagination. Calvino doesn't answer any questions but he most certainly engages and expands these kinds of thoughts.",2010-08-11 01:43:25,5,en,2010-08-11 01:43:25,8,2010,0.00099,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,354
jim,"So apparently I read this book like three years ago... While I recall having started it, I do not recall finishing it. I recall being annoyed by the meandering storyline and seeming lack of destination. I have a difficult time valuing the journey over, or even as much as, the destination, so this book, I thought, was not for me.Having just finished If on a Winter's Night a Traveler last night and not yet having received my next Amazon package, I decided to revisit this one. I'm glad that I did. I am definitely in a different place right now, and the lessons learned from the previous novel definitely combined to make this an entirely different and enjoyable experience. ""It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear."" Perhaps that is my biggest takeaway this time.I can't say there was a huge payoff at the end this time... I can't say that I really fully learned anything except to continue to value a story for when and where it exists without needing something grander to lend it credence. I had to become a listener here... not looking for a meaning but just enjoying the tales being related by someone with experiences vastly different from my own. Calvino just let his imagination run wild. I felt like every description was the beginning (or end) of a much larger and more interesting story... but somehow was still able to let each one come into existence and quickly fade away without feeling cheated. Especially today when we all want sequels and prequels and behind-the-scenes... it became refreshing to just take these glimpses into societies that will never exist. Or have always existed.I would find it difficult to really recommend this to anyone as I feel like it definitely requires a particular state of mind to allow one's self to become immersed in and appreciate such a string of seemingly unrelated tales.

Aj Swaim,"A great novel about Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, what could be better?This story takes place when Marco Polo goes to Kublai Khan's palace to report to him what all of the cities in his kingdom are like so he can know how to rule them in an effective manner. When asked to explain cities that he has visited, Polo responds by placing alternately named cities describing different aspects of Venice. When Kublai discovers this, he is upset and tells Polo to tell him about the city he asks of when he asks and Venice when he wants to hear about Venice. After this realization, Kublai is told many tales of cities from far away lands and thinks that they are like a game of chess: everything has a specific meaning and purpose that can be better explained through chess than through words. Kublai pulls out his atlas out with every city from the past to cities that have not been created yet and Polo has a name for every city shown, even those that have not been fantasized about. The tale ends when Kublai inquires of Polo if everything is an inferno, inferring this from all of Polo's tales, and Polo responds: It is, and there are two ways to live with this inferno: Ignore it and eventually forget its existent, or the harder way of recognizing those who recognize it and keeping your distance from them.The wording and philosophy in this book are excellent. The philosophical answer Polo gives Kublai at the end turns many things that you would think to be true in your life on their heads and showing a completely different idea about certain aspects of life. The author uses an extensive vocabulary which aids the story in imagery and many other important factors of writing that is reflected in this story. The only downside of this book is the plot sequence is confusing at times and on occasions, who or what is being spoken of is difficult to distinguish. Additionally, a large portion of this book is written in italics which (in my opinion) impedes reading speeds, but in all other aspects, this is an exemplary fluent and musing book.",2013-05-17 09:51:51,4,en,2013-05-17 09:51:51,5,2013,0.00068,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,366

Matt,"This book is essentially a collection of prose poetry loosely centered around the theme of cities, with a framing story of Marco Polo describing to Kublai Khan the places he's seen on his travels. The cities described are displaced in time and reality, and are used as metaphors to explore many different aspects of life, thought, and experience. Kublai trying to make sense of the cities is in some way reflective of the reader trying to make sense of life.This quote from the book is representative of the writing style and themes: ""Perhaps, Kublai thought, the empire is nothing but a zodiac of the mind's phantasms. 'On the day when I know all the emblems,' he asked Marco, 'shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?' And the Venetian answered: 'Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be an emblem among emblems.'""I enjoyed the book, but some criticisms I have are that the themes explored never seem to move anywhere or to develop significantly. At times it seemed that chapters became repetitive, or that unfinished ideas were thrown in as filler. The book did not have to be divided into eleven themes, with exactly five cities per theme. That particular choice didn't really add much to the book, and caused it to drag. The chapters could be read in any order really, and out of context from the other chapters, without losing much. The framing story of Marco Polo and Kublai Khan also doesn't seem to experience much development. I think the entire thing could have benefitted from being shortened by half, or even more. There were also too many Polo-Khan interludes, and they retread the same ground too heavily. These interludes could also have been tightened more, and reduced in number, to transition more steadily from a realistic historical meeting to a metaphorical one existing only in thought.Overall, I think the book has an interesting concept, and the prose is often nice to read, but the book is also too long and aimless, and many of the ideas seem unfinished.",2019-10-25 00:16:20,2,en,2019-10-25 00:16:20,10,2019,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,346
Jeff Scott,"We often ignore the beauty right in front of us. Enamored at first, the aspects that made it beautiful become mundane, invisible. I can imagine the look of someone on vacation in New York or Los Angeles gazing at the city in wonder, amazed, only to have some local exclaim, “Tourist!” It’s the beauty we lose over time that takes an outsider to restore our vision of the beauty all around us. Marco Polo really visited Kubla Khan; however, I would imagine their conversation went much differently than this book. It’s a touch point for Calvino’s imagination. He describes futuristic sci-fi worlds and fantasies that become metaphors for our hopes, dreams, and cynicism. All the beauty is around you, but all you can do is to look down at your feet, hurrying along on your way. Calvino wants you to observe, to see again. His Borgean, surreal dreams will give you new perspective on everything. So many different cities, so many ways to see them, yet they are all one. A beautiful book meant to be read and re-read. It’s easily accessible, mind-expanding, and insightful like a religion.

Scott Woody,"Invisible Cities is a book best consumed in drips and drops; a short BART ride here, 15 minutes in the afternoon there. The fables are structured as one or two page descriptions of physical cities, and if you try to push through large sections of the book, the descriptions will blur together. I tried it, and as a result, I ended up re-reading large sections of the book.The highlights of the book are definitely the imaginative cities:In Chloe, a great city, the people who move through streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another; meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping.These complex, detailed descriptions are finished with a take-away about the nature of people derived from observations of the cities. These final observations are often obtuse and require detailed study of the city description to understand. This gives Invisible Cities a puzzle quality where you read a story, read the conclusion, and re-read the story through the lens of the conclusion. The majority of the stories have non-obvious, non-trivial connections between city-description and fable-conclusion, so when they click together, it is deeply satisfying.Invisible Cities was a mixed bag for me. The descriptions of each city were captivating and the aforementioned puzzle-quality felt like an intellectual game. The breadth of topics covered in the fables is vast, and I'd love to treat Invisible Cities as a reference work. However, this is difficult because the story titles are vague (e.g. Thin Cities 3 or Cities &amp; Eyes 2) and the structure and content is the same across all tales. In the end, I'll undoubtedly pull out Invisible Cities and re-read random chapters, looking for inspiration and a quick dopamine hit.",2015-03-09 08:55:57,3,en,2015-03-09 08:55:57,3,2015,0.00071,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,307

Anna,"This book is only 160 pgs and yet it took me a week to read. In my defense, I only read it on the bus to and from work, and even then I would only get through a few pages at a time because of how dense each passage was. Don't be fooled by the length; you'll need to go slowly and really linger on each chapter in order to appreciate Calvino's rich imagery. ""Invisible Cities"" isn't really a story, it's more an experience. Instead of trying to describe it I'd rather transcribe passages:--Already the Great Khan was leafing through his atlas, over the maps of the cities that menace in nightmares and maledictions: Enoch, Babylon, Yahooland, Butua, Brave New World.He said: ""It is all useless, if the last standing place can only be the infernal city, and it is there that, in ever-narrowing circles, the current is drawing us.""And Polo said: ""The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."" ----- the book ends here--This perhaps you do not know: that to talk of Olivia, I could not use different words. If there really were an Olivia of mullioned windows and peacocks, of saddlers and rug-weavers and canoes and estuaries, it would be a wretched, black, fly-ridden hole, and to describe it, I would have to fall back on the metaphors of soot, the creaking of wheels, repeated actions, sarcasm.

Chris,"Without a doubt Invisible Cities is the most intriguing, unusual book I have read. It is so much so a bookseller made a point of telling me it was odd when I bought it off him. He didn’t sound altogether convinced I would enjoy it. The book is at worst surreal and confusing at best beautiful, poetic and meaningful. To describe it best I would say it is, pure and simple, an ode to the city; any city you care to think of. Calvino is clearly a man who appreciated everything about cities from their basic design, location and purpose to the people who live in them.The basic premise of the book is that Kublai Khan, a Chinese Emperor of immense power, has vast territories he can never hope to visit in his lifetime so he employs envoys to travel the globe and report to him on what they have seen. One of these envoys is the Italian adventurer Marco Polo who weaves wonderful descriptions of the many cities he has seen. The descriptions are often brief and rarely take up more than a page (often significantly less) interspersed every ten pages or so are discussions between Kublai and Marco which are often very philosophical in nature.I feel that occasionally Calvino was guilty of being too mysterious and cryptic. Sometimes I just didn’t understand what he was trying to say;“It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist…” By and large I found the book fun, entertaining and meaningful but I would say it is certainly not a book for everyone and it takes a lot of hard work and imagination to appreciate it",2014-03-05 20:27:29,3,en,2014-03-05 20:27:29,3,2014,0.00062,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,330
Erica Toews,"""When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.""""And you know that in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camel's swaying or the junk's rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at every solstice and at every equinox.""""The empire is being crushed by its own weight,"" Kublai thinks, and in his dreams now cities light as kites appear, pierced cities like laces, cities transparent as mosquito netting, cities like leaves' veins, cities lined like a hand's palm, filigree cities to be seen through their opaque and fictitious thickness.""""Perhaps everything lies in knowing what words to speak, what actions to perform, and in what order and rhythm; or else someone's gaze, answer, gesture is enough; it is enough for someone to do something for the sheer pleasure of doing it, and for his pleasure to become the pleasure of others: at that moment, all spaces change, all heights, distances; the city is transfigured, becomes crystalline, transparent as a dragonfly.""",2016-01-11 05:59:08,5,en,2016-01-11 05:59:08,1,2016,0.00421,0.0001,0.00026,0.00014,0.00035,0.00023,316
Rick Adams,"Italo Calvino is a conceptual magician. I suppose his work is compared to Borges, Murakami, and other surrealists. But really, if you ask anyone who’s read his work, they’d say it’s incomparable. He is only himself.The theme of the book is a poetic journey through the eyes of Marco Polo, the explorer. Kublai Khan, the ruler of the old Tartars, commissions Polo to set out and see his empire and record the vast plethora of cities that reside under his rule. Throughout the book, each city is analyzed in poetry, and Polo and Khan reconvene occasionally to digest. A summary will never do justice. But here is a snippet of one of my favorite exchanges:“All this so that Marco Polo could explain or imagine explaining or be imagined explaining or succeed finally in explaining to himself that what he sought was always something lying ahead, and even if it was a matter of the past it was a past that changed gradually as he advanced on his journey, because the travelers past changes according to the route he has followed: not the immediate past, that is, to which he each day that goes by and adds a day, but the more remote past. Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places”.For me, this is saying that the only possessor can be your mind, and even now our mind is naively reduced. So possessing already assumes the truth of its own possibility. This is the sentence that finishes the chapter:“The traveler recognizes the little that is his, discovering the much he has not had and will never have.”So here’s the question: should we start getting comfortable with what we do have, or lean into the discomfort of exploring all of what we don’t? Let me know what you think.",2020-10-24 06:49:13,5,en,2020-10-24 06:49:13,10,2020,0.00148,0.0001,0.00019,0.00012,0.00021,0.00017,331
Kyle,"Calvino's writing is so beautiful. There's more beauty in one of his sentences than in other authors' entire bibliographies. This book barely has a plot and yet it really doesn't matter. It does two things that I really want books to do at this point in my life, make me think and make me pause after a sentence and go, ""Damn that one was tasty"".To demonstrate, on page 9 Calvino states that there are two ways to describe the city of Dorothea. He first lists the various physical features of the city as well as describing its inhabitants. He then provides the second way:Or else you can say, like the camel driver who took me there: ""I arrived here in my first youth, one morning, many people were hurrying along the streets toward the market, the women had fine teeth and looked you straight in the eye, three soldiers on a platform played the trumpet, and all around wheels turned and colored banners fluttered in the wind. Before then I had known only the desert and the caravan routes. In the years that followed, my eyes returned to contemplate the desert expanses and the caravan routes; but now I know this path is only one of the many that opened before me on that morning in Dorothea."" There were so many passages in this novel that make me pause and think, or gave me goosebumps, or really made me slow down to savor a passage (see for example Marco Polo's encounter with the goatherder in Cecilia). I'm afraid that the short sections and lack of a plot will perhaps make my memory of this book fleeting. I feel I'm already losing the passages that I ravenously devoured in a few hours. However I'll always remember how I felt when visiting Calvino's Invisible Cities and I hope my future journeys take me to similar destinations.",2012-09-06 10:45:34,5,en,2012-09-06 10:45:34,9,2012,0.00184,0.00012,0.00036,0.00011,0.00022,0.00016,314
Matt,"If I could, I'd give Invisible Cities 3.5 stars instead of 3, as a consideration for Calvino's epic imagination and clever creativity. Invisible Cities is a expansive lesson in wonder and thought, a masterful series of descriptions for odd, magical, and ethereal cities. Grounding them all is the overarching relationship between Marco Polo, the well-traveled explorer who has visited (and often gotten lost in) each city, and Kublai Khan, the ruler of the empire that houses these cities who hopelessly wishes to understand and command them all. Their conversations are just as complex as the design of each city, as Khan struggles to understand the nature of his rule, and Polo subtly instructs him in humility and wisdom.The cities are split up into various types (""Memory,"" ""Desire,"" ""Thin,"" ""Continuous,"" etc.) which get five chapters each. Because of these categories and the way that they're spaced out in each section, it's probably inevitable that some cities seem a bit too similar with others in their categories. Numerous cities match their designs with the shape of the cosmos, numerous other cities seem to be both everywhere and nowhere. Because there is no typical narrative, reading about city after city after city can also become a bit tedious by the end. These complaints, however, don't detract much from the imaginative worlds Calvino creates. Even in those repetitious categories, there are still cities that feel original and unexpected, a testament to Calvino's ability to defy predictable ideas and discover new ways to think about common concepts. As a whole, this collection of descriptions would be better read in bits and pieces. Then again, with Calvino's writing, it's easy to get carried away, quickly reading from one city to the next.",2013-04-25 04:44:11,3,en,2013-04-25 04:44:11,4,2013,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,286
Michael Heggemann,"Ostensibly, this book is a long conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, with Marco Polo describing 55 different cities, interspersed with short connecting dialogs between the Khan and Polo. And yet, it is much more than that.As the city descriptions go on, the cities become more fanciful, and, at the same time, more modern. It is obvious Polo has never seen many of the cities he describes, usually because they don't exist yet, as is evidenced by his descriptions of such things as skyscrapers, cable cars, radar antennae, munitions factories and the like.Besides the occasional anachronistic object, what makes this book great is the fabulous descriptions of each city, be they fanciful or mundane. The writing is so eloquent that the reader can envision each city with ease, and this is just one of the deeper subjects of the book - an examination of the meaning of existence. Do the cities described actually exist in the world the book is set in, or do the cities exist because Polo is describing them, or will they exist because he is imagining them, or do they exist because we, the readers, can see them so clearly in our mind's eye?Over and above the descriptions of the cities, there is, hovering over the entire proceedings, a certain mathematical exactness or pattern to the presentation of the cities and the structure of the novel itself, but I will leave it to each individual reader to discover that on their own.And even if the reader doesn't care to delve into the deeper meanings hidden away in this fabulous book, it can still be enjoyed as a wonderful set of descriptive narratives that bring to life cities both real and imagined.I highly recommend this book, and expect to read it again and again.",2013-09-12 12:20:47,5,en,2013-09-12 12:20:47,9,2013,0.00063,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,298
Dan Gorman,"This is a puzzle of a book, but well worth a close reading. Calvino imagines a dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, who has tasked Polo with traveling through his empire and reporting back on the state of its cities. The crafty Polo becomes a voice for Calvino's postmodern literary and philosophical ideas, as he describes more than fifty imaginary cities in a succession of fables, tall tales, and logic puzzles. (Reflecting the roguish nature of the explorer, most of the cities are named for women.) The stories, particularly a few of the early ones, showcase the three types of structuralist signs (icons, symbols, and indexical signs), but later stories take up the postmodern idea of deconstruction, of systems breaking down, so that those signs and symbols no longer have fixed meanings. Polo/Calvino leads Khan/the reader through the notion of subjectivity, that what we see in the world and how we define those images rely entirely on what we know. In short, we see in the world what we want to see. As such, the book shows the difficulty of communication and seeing the world on its own merits, instead of what we expect to be in the world. There are passages of great beauty and stunning, almost Geertz-like ""thick descriptions"" of these imaginary cities. The final pages, where Polo encourages Khan to seek the beauty in the world despite subjectivity, are quite beautiful, and a section referencing Platonic forms makes one wonder if Calvino has some sympathy for the traditions of analytic philosophy, as well as his postmodern/Continental philosophy notions. All in all, this is a really cool short read, and very thought provoking. Calvino was a masterful writer, and this is a towering achievement both of fantasy literature and philosophical allegory.",2013-12-05 22:23:58,5,en,2013-12-05 22:23:58,12,2013,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,294
Andrew,"""In the lives of emperors there is a moment which follows pride in the boundless extension of the territories we have conquered, and the melancholy and relief of knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding them""..this lament by Kublai Khan initiates a conversation with the emperor at the beginning of the wane of his influence with Marco Polo, a merchant who has traveled the breadth of the Khan's empire. Polo describes cities and memory, cities and desire, citis and signs, thin cities, trading cities, continuous and even hidden cities. As the conversation continues, Polo intimates all of these places are his native Venice.Calvino writes more about our relationships with our environments than actual cities themselves. One city he mentions was constructed by men who had memories of chasing a great beauty through the streets, who eventually evades them. They build a knew city filled with dead ends to catch her, should they encounter her in the future, and wind up being cursed by their descendants. There's a city built on nets, where the residents rest easily because they know with total certainty their city will eventually fall to earth, and a city where just knowing the names of each thing mean the meaning of that thing cannot be grasped.In other words, reading it is like the sensation of being up waaaay too late picking through some database trying to solve some problem and having that ""what was the question I started out trying to solve"" moment where this wave of meta-paralysis washes over. It's a book that illustrates the dizzying, bewildering missteps we can take when we start to really believe what is possible with ""big data"" Highly recommend.",2014-07-05 07:15:11,5,en,2014-07-05 07:15:11,7,2014,0.00081,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,284
Jimmy Longley,"Reviewed as part of my 100 books challenge: http://jimmylongley.com/blog/books/Run-on Sentence SummaryThe ultimate philosophical travel book, in which Calvino blurs genres by describing fantastical cities in a series of poetic vignettes.ImpressionsSheesh, I have no idea what to think. The premise of the book is a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where Polo describes cities he has seen in his travels to teach the great khan about his empire. The story has no real discernible plot, but is instead a loosely structured series of portraits, describing a series of cities in a couple pages each in a proustian style that borders poetry and prose.A prototypical passage is one in which he describes a city in which you constantly feel as if you are on the outskirts. You can proceed in any direction, but you’ll never feel like you are approaching the center and you begin to fear if you can ever leave. Sort of like life, right? This is the kind of book that I want to like more than I actually do, because I’d be so smart if I did. It is Literature with a capitol L.At certain times I was sucked in by the style, but at other times I found it repetitive, pretentious and boring.

Tapasya,"A truly beautiful and creative book. An epitome of human imagination. The writing is mesmerizing and vivid, the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are deep and insightful. And a wondrous world full of hidden cities and continuous cities and dead cities and cities with desire, memories, eyes and skies lies out there, waiting for you to explore. 
  Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.Thus the city repeats its life, identical, shifting up and down on its empty chessboard. The inhabitants repeat the same scenes, with the actors changed; they repeat the same speeches with variously combined accents; they open alternate mouths in identical yawns. “Memory’s images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,” Polo said. “Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.”I thought: “You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.”KUBLAI: We have proved that if we were here, we would not be.POLO: And here, in fact, we are.If I tell you that the city toward which my journey tends is discontinuous in space and time, now scattered, now more condensed, you must not believe the search for it can stop.

 This book has a special place in my heart. For six months I carried it with me as I went out and about my own city, reading and then re-reading at bus stops, on trains, during lunch breaks, on park benches and random stairwells, until Calvino's poetic prose and endless beautiful metaphors, given through Marco Polo’s descriptions of many fictitious grand cities to Kublai Khan, for the ways cities naturally morph as time passes – seemingly unlovingly and at times almost cannibalistically, as if unsympathetic to what was there before that is now only in our memory – had seeped into my subconscious and subtly colored my own understanding and internal mapping of this perpetually shifting, vanishing and growing city around me. There is the city I live in and move through daily, tangible and increasingly new and unfamiliar as places vanish and buildings get taller; and there is the one within me, fixed only in memory, stubbornly carrying the old and familiar back against this new, whole other city where something else has replaced what ‘used to be’. 
   Despite its pride in its new wealth, the city, at heart, felt itself incongruous, alien, a usurper. And then the shards of the original splendor that had been saved...were now preserved under glass bells, locked in display cases, set on velvet cushions, and not because they might still be used for anything, but because people wanted to reconstruct through them a city of which no one knew anything now.",2019-12-29 15:34:56,5,en,2019-12-29 15:34:56,12,2019,0.00156,0.00011,0.0002,0.00013,0.00021,0.00018,299
Kathleen,"It got better as I progressed through the book.The book comprises a conversation between Marco Polo and Kubla Khan, in which Marco Polo is describing all of the cities he has seen in his travels. One notable feature of the book is that every page describes a new city, and that, strangely, all the cities have women's names. At first I was put off by this, thinking the book to be a long elaborate metaphor for the author's ex-es, but as time went on, I liked the book more as the theme of disintegration and the falling-apart of the supposedly brick-and-mortar became more pronounced. Really you could see each city-description as a self-contained essay on the nature of things witnessed as effervescent, illusory, consisting just as much of comparisons against what one has seen before, as of some ""reality"" external to our eyes. The story-teller/eye-witness himself, Marco Polo, plays the role of philosopher telling the great Khan of the way in which things perceived as stable, essential, or real, turn out to be far more elusive and temporary. The city, a thing we think of as marking the land and lasting for centuries, becomes more and more riddled with holes, both visual and psychological and social, as the book goes on-- the unbelievable cities Marco Polo describes are built on stilts high in the heavens, suspended over cliffs, get torn down and rebuilt regularly, are built like mazes so that dream-women will be captured within, are split into 2 or 3, and sometimes can't be seen by visitors at all. Full of great thoughts. I still, however, don't fully understand why all the cities have women's names.

Ashkan,"From there, after six days and seven nights, you arrive at Zobeide, the white city, well exposed to the moon, with streets wound about themselves as in a skein. They tell this tale of its foundation: men of various nations had an identical dream. They saw a woman running at night through an unknown city; she was seen from behind, with long hair, and she was naked. They dreamed of pursuing her. As they twisted and turned, each of them lost her. After the dream they set out in search of that city; they never found it. but they found one another; they decided to build a city like the one in the dream. In laying out the streets, each followed the course of his pursuit; at the spot where they had lost the fugitive’s trail, they arranged spaces and walls differently from the dream, so she would be unable to escape again.This was the city of Zobeide, where they settled, waiting for that scene to be repeated one night. None of them, asleep or awake, ever saw the woman again. The city’s streets were streets where they went to work every day, with no link any more to the dreamed chase. Which, for that matter, had long been forgotten.New men arrived from other lands, having had a dream like theirs, and in the city of Zobeide, they recognized something of the streets of the dream, and they changed the positions of arcades and stairways to resemble more closely the path of the pursued woman and so, at the spot where she had vanished, there would remain, no avenue of escape.The first to arrive could not understand what drew these people to Zobeide, this ugly city, this trap.From Chapter 3, Invisible citiesBy Italo Calvino",2015-09-20 14:05:28,3,en,2015-09-20 14:05:28,9,2015,0.00153,0.00011,0.0002,0.00014,0.00022,0.0002,294

Chapters are assigned categories, such as Cities and Memory, Hidden Cities, Cities and the Dead, Cities and Desires, Continuous Cities, etc. In between MP and KK consider whether they even exist and are having this conversation or just imagining it, how you define a city, or whether MP is a dubious storyteller and has ever been to these cities or is just imagining, and what would be the difference anyhow if that were the case?The concept appealed to me, it was the execution that tripped me up. It has been more than 10 years since I studied philosophy at college, and my love for it may have waned in the intervening years, or it may just have been Calvino's prose. It was hard to tell which was the culprit, but either way I found myself slogging through chapters, and rolling my eyes on ocassion. Some of the thoughts are profound, but the writing is often flowery and overblown, and just gets in the way rather than assists the reader in digesting big concepts. I had to keep putting the book down for a few days to ruminate in between chapters. The lack of plot and seeming disconnect between cities and chapters didn't help. There was no momentum to keep you engaged from one description to the next.",2013-09-05 23:30:53,2,en,2013-09-05 23:30:53,9,2013,0.00076,0.00012,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,269
Tony,"Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.I could never be quite sure what I was reading here. It's generally listed as a novel, but it seems more like a collection of inter-related short stories. But even ‘short stories’ is misleading. This is really just a series of vignettes, many barely a couple of hundred words long, framed as Marco Polo describing to Kublai Khan the cities he encountered on his expeditions, though with occasional jolts back into the present, such as when he muses on how the airport → suburbs → downtown → hotel → shopping experience in many cities is now so identical in many places you can only tell where you are by the large lettered sign of the airport name. It's the sort of thing that would make an excellent Peter Greenaway movie. The book is fully of pithy little aphorisms (“You take delight not in a city’s seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.” / “Each man bears in his mind a city made only of differences, a city without figures and without form, and the individual cities fill it up.” / “The unhappy city contains a happy city unaware of its own existence” etc), and though I raced through it in a few hours, it seems like the sort of book that would repay a much, much slower reading. Though, of course, it's also the very epitome of a book that, per Heraclitus, you can never actually read twice. ★★★★",2014-11-19 07:55:42,4,en,2014-11-19 07:55:42,11,2014,0.00098,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00019,0.00015,287
Pádraic,"There's something that's been bugging me about Calvino ever since I read If on a Winter's Night a Traveller, and halfway through Invisible Cities I finally got it: his work has no heart.Which seems like too harsh of a thing to say <s>and still have a four-star rating</s>. The thing is, I do like the two Calvino books I've read. 'Like' is maybe the word that needs replacing here. 'Appreciate' is probably closer. This is, at one level, a work of staggering invention. I'm tempted to say there's enough ideas here for as many novels as there are cities--but I don't think that's true. Individually none of them are more than sketches, hashed out on the back of a napkin and slid across the table. 'Oh sure, Italo, old pal, that's pretty cool,' I say.Which it is! But taken as a whole I find the whole exercise exhausting--numbing, even. If you've read half a dozen of these stories, you've read them all. It's like an exquisitely complicated array of scaffolding that doesn't actually surround a building, just an empty space. Or just more scaffolding. Which might actually be something from one of the cities, who knows, I've forgotten all of them already.It's cool, it's interesting, but I can't feel anything about it. It leaves me cold, hollow. It's just an academic exercise. However, he's so good at these exercises I'll probably end up reading more.",2015-08-03 07:54:41,0,en,2015-08-03 07:54:41,8,2015,0.00093,0.00011,0.0002,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,235
David,"It only occurred to me fairly recently what a beautiful thing a good translation is. Beautiful writing in one language is difficult enough, but to interpret into a new language and create beauty is just as wonderful. Here, the beauty is in the language, but also in the surreal and metaphorical imagery of the book. Invisible Cities is built of Marco Polo's tales to Kublai Khan. He tells of strange, fantastic cities that are clearly impossible and yet oddly familiar. A city that is repeated all over the world, surrounding every airport, to greet you with sameness at the end of each flight. A city built by a series of architects, trying to fashion the perfect space where the one that got away, cannot. Each city has a perfect surreal logic that gives the reading experience a dreamlike feel. You drift out of one and into another, without any connection other than beautiful absurdity.Over time it becomes clear that every city in the book is Venice, but could also be any other city in the world. Each city is a perfect reflection of some element of cityness, and each one feels hauntingly familiar. The cities also come to represent more, standing in as structures of memory, desire, language, and humanity. It's a beautiful book, and one that I recommend to everyone, city-slicker and bumpkin alike....On an unrelated note, it was infuriating when I reached the section on a city whose description was stunningly like the subject of a story of mine. There's something discouraging about stumbling upon fiction with close parallels to my own when it's this well done.",2015-12-31 21:08:20,4,en,2015-12-31 21:08:20,12,2015,0.00071,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,269
আনিকা (anika),"Calvino's lyrical prose in Invisible Cities immerses the reader in a world of complexity and patterns similar to those found in M. C. Escher's prints. This page turning short novel evolves around conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan that are based on Polo's travel reminiscences. Calvino's mastery of words dissolves each chapter into a series of dreamy visual, theoretical, and mathematical illustrations. The meticulously crafted category of cities (dreams, memories, signs, the eyes, the names, hidden cities) weaves elements of empires, languages, lands, tales, and traditions that shape the invisible cities of our world. Have you ever considered the cities we live in, cities we travel to, the concept of cities in general are after all just a figment of our imagination? Cities are invisible, cities are mere ideas, it's the collective ""imagination of cities"" that we reside in.",2017-02-09 07:07:02,5,en,2017-02-09 07:07:02,2,2017,0.00073,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,140
Sarita,"“It is true that the city is accompanied by two projections of itself, one celestial and one infernal; but the citizens are mistaken about their consistency.""The story is about imaginary conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan where the Venetian traveler describes the cities he has visited in his travels to the Emperor. Khan does not necessarily believe all the things Polo says and challenges him with questions which I find very amusing.The description of the city does not fit the bill in terms of architectural concept but it speaks to me in so many different ways and makes me wonder about the cities I've lived in or visited. About what I remember of each place —the name, the landscape, the citizens, and my own state of mind when I was there.I finished reading this book few weeks ago but I wasn't sure how to write a decent review for such beautiful work. As Sunday Times writes: A subtle and beautiful meditation. I found myself reading a chapter and then closing my eyes for few minutes to absorb all the beauties!“And Polo said: ‘The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.

Ben,"There is a lot going on in this tiny book. A mix of historical fiction, fantasy, philosophy, and dreams, 'Invisible Cities' is fascinating, confusing, brilliant, and unintelligible at the same time. As Marco Polo describes cities to Kublai Khan, Calvino exposes many of the fallacies that we have about ourselves, our lives, and our societies. In the challenges and discussions between the two characters, he questions our conceptions of history, society, life, death, love, civilization, and cities in and of themselves. What are boundaries? How much is any city the same as the one which carried the same name 10 years ago? 25? 50? 500? 'Invisible Cities' is one of those rare books that not only questions perceptions, but in not necessarily providing answers to those questions does not leave the reader frustrated or unsatisfied. Well, in many senses I am unsatisfied: with knowing that I've finished the book, with knowing that I do not know the answers to the questions. And while I am still in many ways confused, I cannot help but have been absolutely enraptured by the book; and I definitely plan on reading it a few more times (at least) to try and make some more sense of it. As Gore Vidal is quoted as saying on the back of the book: ""Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvelous invention like 'Invisible Cities,' perfectly irrelevant.""",2010-01-19 07:26:54,5,en,2010-01-19 07:26:54,1,2010,0.00076,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,242

Olivia,"While all literature could be described as art, there are arguably some books that are more art-like than others. Invisible Cities would be one of those, and in it, your mind is what is used as a canvas. And it's a troublesome canvas Calvino has chosen for his paintings; it is as far from blank as possible, already coloured by the thousands of books we've read before, stained from what conversations we've overheard. Calvino uses these colours and pieces, and he rearranges them into cities. Hidden cities, dead cities, diaphanous cities, all of them are conjured up in your mind as you leaf through this book.Books without an overt plot intrigue me. Invisible Cities could be accused of not really having a story or pulling in any direction. To decipher this one, you'll have to put in some work. You could treat it like an encyclopaedia of cities that have never been and at the same time rests within every one that is, or you could treat it as a transcription of philosophical discussions between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. Either way works, and both pay off. Invisible Cities is the kind of book that never grows tired, no matter how many times you turn its pages. I imagine picking this up at times of writer's block, just to read a city or two (preferably Cities &amp; Eyes 1 or Cities &amp; the Dead 2). They are bittersweet little stories where every place is ambiguous and no road certain.

Moushumi Ghosh,"Another genre and mind bender from Calvino. Invisible Cities is very difficult to describe. I can't outline a plot and tell you this book is about this thing and that person. I can say for sure that this is fiction. There are two main characters and hundreds of unnamed supporting characters. These supporting characters are the people who populate the invisible cities. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan have conversations that never end (who wouldn't want that?) and where they are mentally sparring with each other. Their area of interest - cities, their characteristics, what they hide, what they show, what they declare, what they bury. For Marco Polo, these cities all show a facet of Venice. There are times when I wondered where the plot was going but that was my mistake. This is not a plot-driven book. This is an imagination-driven one. I had to learn to have 'moments of generous abandon' (Calvino, 101) in order to appreciate this book. I had literally go into a trance to grasp at what the book was trying to convey. When I gave up trying to make sense of it, it made a lot of sense. This is one of those books which expects your complete surrender before it gives you anything. Oh, it is worth the wait. It's completely different from other Calvino books. Some people consider it Cavino's masterpiece. I am yet to read ALL his oeuvre, so I will reserve my judgement on that.

Andreea,"""With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else....the people who move through the streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another; meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping...Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.The city is redundant: it repeats itself so that something will stick in the mind.""A compendium of possible cities unfolded from a dialogue between Marco Polo and the Khan. Cities that are shapeless, redundant, dreamed, their own outskirts, voluptuous, that are mirrored by their sibling cities in the waters or death.

Vicki,"Italo Calvino is an author new to me. This is the first of his books I have read and it is lyrical, almost merging prose with poetry, offering descriptions rich in visual imagination. The translator, William Weaver, deserves commendation for rendering the Italian into richly satisfying English.The genre Calvino is associated with is new to me also, and it is Magical Realism. Invisible Cities is an imagined conversation between the aging emperor Kublai Khan and the young explorer Marco Polo. Khan and his Tartars have conquered lands so vast that he cannot hope to visit every city, and he is fascinated as the young Venetian describes city after city within the realm. But the descriptions are so imaginative and sometimes so fantastic that it is hard to accept as real. At the same time, Khan is always eager for Polo's return so that the philosophical conversations might continue.Polo's descriptions indicate that the cities have many facets, and in fact may be different cities, depending on whether one is viewing from afar or from within. The same city may be new and vibrant or dirty and decaying. Khan begins to feel that he may learn more from the atlas and maps in his palace than from the vivid descriptions of the explorer. Polo responds to one of Khan's probes with the intriguing thought that ""...it is not the voice that commands the story. It is the ear.""And that quote goes along way in describing the experience of the reader of this fascinating book.",2015-11-01 01:45:32,3,en,2015-11-01 01:45:32,11,2015,0.00074,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,252
Leigh Anne,"In Xanadu did Kublai Khan play Marco Polo. Or maybe the other way around.Calvino's novel is short on plot, long on imagination, and will please those who enjoy experimental fiction. The premise is that Marco Polo is telling Kublai Khan tales of the cities he has seen in his many travels. Of course, the two men don't have language in common, so the great explorer communicates mostly in images. And yet, the emperor slowly grows to understand. Many of the cities are named after women, and impossible things happen in all of them. The cityscapes are dreamlike nad mostly gentle, though there are a few troubling descriptions mixed in. The overall effect is kind of like throwing a deck of tarot cards down and shuffling through them. Calvino uses a chess metaphor late in the novel that is also apt.It's clear we are not meant to take any of this literally, but what do the symbols mean? The best answer, of course, is, what do you want them to mean? Although there is an order imposed on the text, you could technically read the chapters in any order and still have it make sense. This is a nice book for an idle summer day when you have all the time in the world to soak up the language and images, and speculate on what resonance they hold for you personally. Calvino's works are contemporary classics, so add this to medium-to-large fiction collections, as well as academic library fiction collections.",2016-06-07 09:47:28,3,en,2016-06-07 09:47:28,6,2016,0.00091,0.00011,0.00019,0.00012,0.00019,0.00016,249
Jef Sneider,"Italo Calvino is a genius and his mastery of words and language is displayed in this little book of reflections. I cannot imagine how the translator or Calvino, came up with the words in this book! The words are exquisite. The images full of depth and convolutions and shadows and spires and staircases and every embellishment imaginable in a place built by people. Having just returned from Italy when I read this book, I could see Calvino's beloved Venice in many of his cities, and Rome. Americans have to understand what it is like to be in a country like Italy, with history that goes back 2500 years. Cities are built, grow, decline and fall, and are rebuilt over and over - in the same place! In Rome, if you visit the Coloseum you see the remnants of a very old city. The marble has been stripped away over the centuries; some of it then used to build the Vatican. The iron used to hold columns together has been stripped and melted down for weapons - first for swords, and eventually for guns. Imagine living in Rome in decline, in poverty, with the colosseum towering over hovels as a testimony to better times. The people steal from the old and ancient to survive the present. Preservation is not on their minds.While Marco Polo and the Great Khan muse over the great cities of the Khan's kingdom, the Great Khan is imagining what his kingdom and the world are like.

Daniel,"We connect so much to the place we inhabit. We fill the spaces in which we live with projections of ourselves, of our hopes and desires, our fears and traumas, and our humor and anxiety. All these things, though fleeting in the moment, live forever in time and memory, nestled together like metaphorical buildings in an invisible city. Italo Calvino, writing in his unmistakable poetic prose , masterfully manages to briefly capture all of the realities and perceptions that so often clash, yet all share the same space. In this timeless, fabulistic travelogue the wry Marco Polo and the morose Kublai Khan play mind games with each other, the great Khan asking questions about his ailing empire, and Polo answering in parables, tales of cities that are both real and unreal, which seek to answer the Khan's questions. As the book unfolds, we the readers come to find out that there are no cities, real or otherwise, but only Marco Polo's own question, and the answer he cannot quite find for himself. How should we live? What is the proper way to lead a life, especially when complicated by a myriad of circumstances outside of our control, from the natural like drought, to the man-made, like imperialistic aggression? In the end, unfortunately, there is no single answer. Empires fade, explorers retire, and endings turn into new beginnings.

Andy,"I recently re-read this book because I felt like I didn't have enough magic and enchantment in my literary life. What I wrote in my first review back in 2007 holds: Invisible Cities feels more like poetry than prose. The book consists of 55 descriptions of fictitious places as imagined to have been described by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. From time to time Polo and the Khan converse as well, but these are filler/fodder as far as I'm concerned; the joy in reading this book is in the cities. The cities are the stuff of fantasy: a city suspended on a web over a valley, a city that periodically moves and leaves webs behind where it has been, a concentric matryoshka-doll city where new versions of itself grow from within. I still find the prose beautiful, although I think as I've aged I've started to favor more direct, less baroque styles of writing, and no one should come to this book expecting an economy of words. Since writing my original review, I've spent five more years living in one of the capital-C Cities of the world, New York, and have only grown to love the urban life more and more. If you've ever felt the same way, ever been stirred by floating through masses of humanity and forests of glass and concrete and simply breathing in the richness of activity and speech and motion that pervades a city, I humbly recommend this book to you.",2007-03-15 09:21:21,5,en,2007-03-15 09:21:21,3,2007,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,246

Although I liked it the first time, I was surprised that it was the book that made him popular in the States in the 1970s.

Despite its brevity, I could imagine enjoying this book for many years on a desert island.The book opens with a statement that questions the validity of storytelling: “Kublai Khan does not necessarily believe everything Marco Polo says when he describes the cities visited on his expedition.” (On the back of the book's first edition, Calvino writes that the book ""proceeds by discussing and questioning itself."") And on that same first page, the book offers a grand justification for storytelling: “Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern.”I first read Calvino about a decade ago, and was instantly taken with his imagination. He seems almost to transcend genre, especially with a book like this. Fiction? Yes, but only if it's also poetry and nonfiction at the same time. He remains a model for me.",2007-04-28 14:53:49,5,en,2007-04-28 14:53:49,4,2007,0.00059,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,225
Laura,"“The wares, too, which the vendors display on their stalls are valuable not in themselves but as signs of other things …. Your gaze scans the streets as if they were written pages: the city says everything you must think, makes you repeat her discourse, and while you believe you are visiting Tamara you are only recording the names with which she defines herself and all her parts.”“Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real of hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.”“I thought: ‘You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living.

Brian,"Some readers report that if you take a hard right at the third shelf past the study carrels you'll find Invisible Cities -- a tome, they report unanimously, of 165 pages translated from the Italian.The bibliophile wonders, though, at the diversity of these reports in other respects. Some readers recall Invisible Cities as a novel, others as a poem in free verse; still others insist that it is both. The book is most comparable to Gulliver's Travels, say some readers; no, reply others, it is more like Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird. Still others interrupt and compare it to an anime -- Kino no Tabi -- or a didactic psychogeography -- Dante's Inferno -- or a work of playful but overconscious intellectualism -- Godel, Escher, Bach. I myself have just read Invisible Cities and can tell you that each of these reports is entirely accurate and also entirely misguided.Perhaps the sagest conclusion about a work called by such different names is that it is impossible, that Invisible Cities is a chimera of an imagination too long deprived of chimeras. Yet once conceived by one such fevered imagination, if such a work did not exist it would become necessary to create it, as a wise man once said on a different topic. And thus the Invisible Cities stir, I can say, before those with eyes to see them.",2009-02-12 16:39:27,5,en,2009-02-12 16:39:27,2,2009,0.00073,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,229
???????,"I don't know how to describe this book. And I think that's the whole point.Like Marco Polo attempting to describe the Ideal City by describing its shadows, trying to encapsulate this book by referencing its style or providing a synopsis or talking about its content is somehow insufficient. I'll do my best anyway.I think the best way to describe this book is by referencing one of its passages. There's a passage in which Kublai Khan contemplates an empty square on a chessboard. Polo extrapolates the history of the maple and ebony trees used to create the board, the forest that houses the trees, the river that runs by the forest, the houses built by the river, and so on.This is a story about storytelling. The cities Polo describes are none of them empirically real, and yet each of them describes a truth about cities and the people who live within them, and the world that endures their presence. I can try to describe this book in a number of ways. It is magical realism. It is post modernism. It is short. It is complex. It's poetic, metaphysical, fractal, beautiful. All of these things are true, and yet insufficient descriptions. Everything Polo says is also true, and yet somehow incomplete.This is a beautiful story, if nothing else.

Fraser Kinnear,"Fantastic, this is a book I'm going to need to read one or two more times to really digest. It's short, and I read it in an evening. At first pass, this book made me think about travel, and the emotional experience of extended travel. There's certainly much more packed in these pages, however, but the ideas float through the book in an ephemeral haze. For instance, some of the descriptions of cities highlighted ideas like waste in cities or the evolving landscape of cities, while other conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan (the only two characters in the book) address the changing nature of memory. But how do these ideas connect? Why are they all in one book?The cities described are afforded enough detail to have a unique character, but Calvino seems to be constantly reminding us that focus on details and architecture leads one to mistake the trees for the forest - or, more aptly, the stones for the bridge:""Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone.'But which is the stone that supports the bridge?' Kublai Khan asks.'The Bridge is not supported by one stone or another,' Marco answers, 'but by the line of the arch that they form.'Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: 'Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me.'Polo answers: 'Without stones there is no arch.'""",2011-04-04 14:12:57,4,en,2011-04-04 14:12:57,4,2011,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,234
Ursula,"I'm not sure what to say about Invisible Cities. If you require a storyline, you shouldn't read it. But if you can be drawn in by vignettes about imaginary cities, alternating with (possibly also imaginary) conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, you will probably enjoy it. Polo has traveled throughout the Khan's kingdom and is ostensibly describing cities therein to him. However, they're all pretty wild-sounding cities: one city is symbolic, with every item in them representing something else; another was built in the form of a maze to trap a woman in a dream; yet another is built like a spiderweb over an abyss. The Khan questions Polo about the truth in his stories, and also why the only city he never seems to mention is the one he comes from, Venice.I was charmed by the cities, by their whimsicality but also their underlying truths. I am not a huge fan of philosophy, but I even enjoyed the conversational musings of Kublai Khan and Marco Polo. And as a bonus, this did more to enhance my understanding of Venice than any nonfiction book has so far.Recommended for: dreamers, architects and city planners, anyone who lives in a city.Quote: ""Millions of eyes look up at windows, bridges, capers, and they might be scanning a blank page.

I shall repeat the reason why I was describing it to you: from the number of imaginable cities we must exclude those whose elements are assembled without a connecting thread, an inner rule, a perspective, a discourse. With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.'''3) '''Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,' Polo said.

Natasha Vag,"Books that reside permanently in my head.'Invisible Cities' by Italo CalvinoMagic Realism meets Semiotic Rigor in this influential, experimental, whimsical, revealing, engaging collection of snapshots of every urban stop on the way to Xanadu. Marco Polo regales Kublai Khan with tales of his travels to 55 fictional cities, sorted through a rubric of 11 thematic lenses. Short and sweet -- a very quick read -- Calvino at his brainy best, which means an awful lot coming from me. Bright and silly, yet deeply contemplative, recommended for both the hardened traveller and the soft homebody. A taste:“When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the desire for a city. Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking of all these things when he desired a city. Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a row with them. Desires are already memories.”",2014-08-08 04:33:41,5,en,2014-08-08 04:33:41,8,2014,0.00138,0.0001,0.0002,0.00011,0.00021,0.00018,226
Virginia Mekkelson,"Loved this book! It's full of ideas. It's very short. I recommended it, especially to people who enjoy thinking.Marco Polo describes cities that he has visited to the aging Kublai Khan as they walk in the Great Khan's gardens. The descriptions of each city are only a few pages long, some only one page. The descriptions are amusing, charming, and clearly convey what kind of a city it is. The descriptions also feel personal, as if one observer is moving through the city and noting what is of interest or important in that city to that observer.Ideas are plentiful. Each city is very different. After a while, it becomes apparent that the differences are the result of the differences in individual perceptions. We see what we want to see, we see according to our wants, our needs, our wishes. Reality is subjective. Slowly we realize the descriptions all apply to the same city.I thought half-way through Calvino would run out of ideas, but he didn't! He cleverly went deeper and deeper into the nature of reality.This little book isn't structured like an ordinary novel, but because Calvino is writing about something important - how our perceptions create our world - it holds my attention all the way through. And it's not full of philosophical mumbo-jumbo - his imaginative and inventive descriptions convey very complex ideas painlessly.",2015-12-10 04:59:44,5,en,2015-12-10 04:59:44,12,2015,0.00079,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,226
refgoddess,"Italy Calvino is a total tease, and brilliantly poetic. He flips sumptuous descriptions past the reader, hinting at untold stories and hidden meanings. You want to ponder every word, every image, but you also want to know what he's really saying, where he's going. In this book, you are one with Kublai Khan, immersed in the stories brought by the clever young trader Marco Polo, but questioning, wanting to control the ending, wanting to make sense of it all. Is he talking about one city, Venice? Is he making it up? What is he telling us about the world, about people and their ways of creating and living in the world? And yet, what amazing cities he has conceived: doubles of each other, lost pasts, deconstructed walls, canals in the desert. I especially liked the city which was abandoned when everyone grew tired of their roles and reassembled nearby, with everyone living in new homes, with new roles. The lives remained the same, but the people living the lives changed. Trippy, man.This is probably not the best book to read while recovering from bronchitis, exhausted and foggy-brained. But somehow this sumptuous fever dream fits. I had to leave it behind in the house where I was sleeping and watching over Walter the cat, but I'm curious to learn what a clearer mind will make of it.",2016-04-06 00:37:40,4,en,2016-04-06 00:37:40,4,2016,0.00203,0.0001,0.00022,0.00012,0.00023,0.00018,226

He is speaking to the emperor, trying to describe places to someone who has never seen and will never see them. He begins making up cities and stories.

Reid,"I had never read any Calvino before this spring and loved If On a Winter's Night a Traveler. Calvino writes like a more patient Borges, exploring the passages one at a time branching off the main cave gallery. In this breathtakingly elegant work, Calvino shows us cities rife with contradiction, told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan, with dialogues bookending the city descriptions. The short, meditative reflections on imagined cities gives the book a nice cadence, a postcard-view of the city, usually with its photo-negative or reflection or inversion presented afterwards. Calvino is clearly a master at this type of wordsmanship, while remaining true to his genuine emotion of decline, loss and heartbreak. At one point, the Khan asks Polo about the city of his birth, Venice: ""Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little."" (87) Most of the stories focus on the various perceptions of cities which differ depending upon how one comes to the city, which part is glimpsed first, whether one grows up in the city or merely travels through it.

Max,"Invisible Cities is a playful deconstruction of the modern city and of the perception of place. Although the writing does not seem to be as lush as in Calvino's Under the Jaguar Sun (a difference in translation, perhaps?), the ideas here take precedence and ably rule the day.Couched in the context of Marco Polo describing his explorations to Genghis Khan, Invisible Cities primarily consists of a series of descriptions of fantastic and unique cities Polo claims to have visited. Gradually it is revealed, through italicized portions of conversation between Polo and the Khan, that these descriptions are actually Polo's abstract analyses of different aspects of Venice, his home city. The Khan appears to use these descriptions similarly to analyze his own empire. This context then allows the reader to do the same.Population, demographics, customs, politics, history, archaeology, and geography: each in turn becomes the primary distinguishing factor of one of these ambiguously imaginary cities; each city is actually a lens for the reader's extrospection on the given topic. Due to Calvino's masterful pacing and descriptive powers, the game never gets tiresome.

Heather,"I first encountered two of the vignettes in Invisible Cities when taking an introduction to fiction class a year and a half ago. From that time, I couldn't get the elegant prose and deep insight of the pieces out of my mind. Having finally finished the book, I would highly recommend this Calvino work to anyone who is comfortable with reading a novel with little to no plot. Far from being annoyed by the descriptive nature of this work, I found myself all the more intrigued and engaged. Invisible Cities details Marco Polo's discussions with the Kublia Khan after his travels throughout Europe. However, as Polo continues speaking, one gets the feeling that Polo might just be messing with the Khan. It took me only one vignette to realize that far from Polo describing actual places, he was giving deep insight into the nature of humanity, of empires, of the desire to create the city itself. While the prose itself is certainly engaging, the ability of the author to communicate truth devoid of pedantic overtones is what grabbed my attention and kept me reading this novel. I am looking forward to reading more of Calvino's work and will likely turn back to Invisible Cities for inspiration in my own writing.",2010-12-27 08:36:46,5,en,2010-12-27 08:36:46,12,2010,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,210
Jason Mills,"A world-weary Kublai Khan seeks news of his sprawling empire from his travelling ambassador Marco Polo. The book consists of Polo's descriptions of strange and far-flung cities, punctuated by dialogues with the Khan. Each of these imagined cities, though not lacking physical detail, is distinguished by some thought-provoking peculiarity that makes it of more interest as a META-physical notion. Argia, for instance, is a buried city whose inhabitants presumably tunnel their way around:""From up here, nothing of Argia can be seen... The place is deserted. At night, putting your ear to the ground, you can sometimes hear a door slam.""It's a short book, but not for me a quick one. Lacking conventional plot and characterisation, it did not pull me along but left me to travel under my own steam (like Polo). But also it was as if the author lowered a barrier at the end of each city's description, a built-in and unavoidable pause for thought. For Calvino is not of course talking about mere cities, but about life, human nature, time, fate, memory and civilisation.It's an intellectual, anachronistic fabulation, a collection of philosophical fragments rather than a traditional novel. As such, it made me think more than feel; but it's no less impressive for that.",2011-02-21 05:43:12,4,en,2011-02-21 05:43:12,2,2011,0.00084,0.00011,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,207
Moseph,"Invisible Cities is basically a series of prose poems, each describing a different city. There are only two characters in the book; the explorer Marco Polo who collects stories about cities and the emperor Kublai Kahn demands to hear about the cities contained in his falling empire. Perhaps the best synopsis of the book is the statement offered by Marco Polo that ���an invisible landscape conditions the visible one.” As a surrealist, I found the book especially captivating because on one level it deals in the fantastical—cities which seem to exist in other dimensions, gargoyles which come to life, and cities that sprawl so rapidly that you cannot escape them. On another level Calvino touches on profound truths about geography and imperialism as well as the social, political and environmental forces that shape cities. I found this book to be tremendously fun, my roommates will attest that it caused me to jump up and down with excitement more than once.

Instead, as they peer out their windows, they gaze upon the architecture of their dreams, shimmering as the rising sun catches the dewy film the fog has left behind on the steel structures.Those that read Invisible Cities claim it is that foghorn.

Matthew,"This easily digestible travelogue supported by a fictitious narration by Marco Polo is memorable and unique. Dozens of depictions of fabricated cities evoke real-world comparisons to sprawling metropolises all over the world. Between sets of cities, a sort of comedic intermission occurs between Polo and Kublai Khan. The overall concept is well-executed; how else can you explain why so many people are fond of this collection of single-paged city descriptions? It reads like architectural porn, really. It isn't perfect, though. Its characteristic brevity is also a detractor; it's hard to care about a city after only a page or two. Also, despite its minimalism, familiar vocabulary like parapet, veranda and estuary get marred by overly particular words with minimal context; words like balustrade, corbel, and trestle. Lastly, although I enjoy prosaic depictions of naked women as much as the next man, the first few chapters curiously feature a lot of young, bathing women tantalizing the unsuspecting traveler.

I chose to read it because I recently read a biography of Genghis Khan and Marco Polo's Travels, so I thought I would really get into this book that recounts a conversation between Genghis's grandson and Polo. But it never really ""clicked"" for me. Calvino's writing is lyrical and pretty, but I really don't think it does well in translation (unlike say, Coelho, Tolstoy, or Balzac). I see the ""point,"" the message of Invisible Cities, but it's not really profound. I kept thinking of Camus's The Fall, a philosophical work completely comprised of a first-person dialogue, and even though that's not one of my favorite books, I really enjoyed it and got a lot out of it. I didn't feel the same way about this book. I found myself reading it quickly, happy for the chapter breaks, and glad that it's a fast read. I just wanted to get through it just to get through it. I'll read something else by Calvino. I think I need to take my time with the next one and appreciate the prose. But if I don't get into that either, I'll just say that Calvino and I are not a literary match and move on.",2014-06-07 08:40:14,2,en,2014-06-07 08:40:14,6,2014,0.00059,0.00013,0.0002,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,241
Mihai,"I understand the structuralism underlying this work, but I did not find it as intellectually stimulating as I had anticipated. Perhaps this had to do with the avalanche of other things I was reading at the same time, including Uspensky's introduction to Gurdjieff's teachings (with which, strangely, I found some parallels) and various school assignments. Perhaps the lack of appeal was also due to the version I was reading - an early English language edition from the 1970s with tattered covers, yellowed and decrepit changes, and text aspect (size, effects, proofing) that left much to be desired. Presentation of the book aside, the stories of some cities were better than others, and I'm sure I'm not the first to note that the anachronisms in some of the descriptions belie the true narrator. To me Invisible Cities is really Calvino using a fictional setting to comment on the modern society's continued experimentation with urban theory. The exchanges between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan feature profound philosophical musings on the nature of language, storytelling and imagination, but overall the book falls short of being a masterpiece, though it is definitely thought-provoking in its own right.",2014-08-13 00:32:13,3,en,2014-08-13 00:32:13,8,2014,0.0006,0.00013,0.00019,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,193
Emmett,"It is hard to describe what this novel is, and indeed it addresses the nature of ingraspability through an extended conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, a conversation possibly imagined to have taken place. Whether or not it does is equally hard to say. Like a desert landscape, the epistemological grounds of Invisible Cities constantly shift without warning; often times the reader finds the carpet laid out in the previous chapter pulled out from beneath their feet in the next one. Are these cities the same city? Are they all different? Have things changed or have they not? Do we know for certain what is it that we hear? What is the nature of the signs by which we ground ourselves and anchor our language, or do we speak a meaningless sequence of gestures, fingers pointing to symbols while the other one nods, all the while assuming that this conversation goes on without accident? These questions haunt the novel, and at intervals, at the appearance of a certain phrase or a picture, one hears a sigh from one or more of these many unanswered ghosts. The only consistent thing left to do is to appreciate the novel's breadth of imagination, and its deft, splendid poetry.",2015-07-24 10:44:23,5,en,2015-07-24 10:44:23,7,2015,0.00073,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,206
Robin Redden,"I loved this book on every possible level. Written in the boundary between prose and poetry and using both a wide lens and focused, it just floats on your mind beautifully. The frame story is written ala Scheherezade and Harun Al Rashid in the (1001) Arabian Nights - instead this is Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in (55) Invisible Cities. Marco Polo describes cities he has visited in the Khan's empire (or is it really only one city, that of Venice? Or any and all cities?). Cities are constructs of human desires, fears, memories. Each story/city contains a conceptual or philosophical mystery. The mathematical order of the story is beautiful (because cities are sustained by varying forces of order - both visible and invisible - are they not?). See Wikipedia's matrix for more on that at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisib.... It's about many things: storytelling and how we hear only what we expect to hear (confirmation bias), the human mind and experience but also how imagination and creativity can triumph over experience, philosophy and self-awareness, exposing varying perspectives and the many perspectives that can be, and the human condition. And that doesn't even come close to describing it. :-)",2017-01-13 05:59:30,5,en,2017-01-13 05:59:30,1,2017,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,196

Liam,"It’s hard to word exactly how powerful this book hit me. It taps into the imagination and how we, as people, use it to understand and create the world around us and ourselves. The myriads of cities Marco describes to Kublai Khan are going to stick with me for a very long timeEdit: Ok I’ve had a bit of distance. Basically, I had read IOAWNAT and came away kinda cold, but this was was short and had a cool cover and I’m a sucker for the sort of magical realist city designs in the book so I picked it up, and it completely blew me away. I almost wanna reread IOAWNAT to see what I was missing. Each city is basically a tiny prose poem that illustrates some aspect of the human condition in a way that is both totally moving and beautiful and completely out of left field, imagination-wise (I mean, it don’t get more poetic that a whole city covered in a network of threads that lead from one persons house to another, different threads for different relationships, until the sheer amount of connections become overwhelming and the city has to move, leaving the web behind. Like, what a perfect way to talk about personal relationships).

If you are curious about Calvino, but haven’t tried him yet, read this first. It’s more accessible than some of his others (but warning: it’s still not that accessible) while still being funny and also giving me so many of those moments where I just think “holy shit”. It’s about imagination and communication and greed and colonialism and wonder. More than anything this book made me feel nostalgic for the past and excited for the future at the same time. “The more one was lost in unfamiliar quarters of distant cities, the more one understood the other cities he had crossed to arrived there, and he retraced the stages of bus journeys, and he came to know the port from which he had set sail, and the familiar places of his youth, and the surroundings of home, and a little square of Venice where he gamboled as a child.” UGH!

Matthew Snope,"I understand this is somewhat regarded as Calvino's masterpiece, but if so, it's a weak masterpiece. It is a collection of vignettes of cities real and imagined, so lacks a narrative tension of characters moving through a story arc (such as other Calvino works like Baron in the Trees). It's not as singularly annoying as the ADD-esque 'If on a winter's night a traveler', with its chapters that begin but cannot stay focused, but it has a bit of the same caffeinated energy to it. It has some beautiful writing, and some of the short chapters seem to be inspired by dream locations and are quite compelling. I learned some new words reading this book. There are some classic Calvino moments in which he does indeed seem to presage postmodern thought, and he makes some good observations about language, philosophy, people. He is no doubt a *clever* writer, admirable. But the hype that preceded my reading of this book, once again, made for a bit of a letdown once I began reading. As can be said of many works, it's good, but it's not as great as some people rave. It's worthwhile, but not life-changing or monumental. I will say, however, it has a quite beautiful and enigmatic ending....",2010-06-15 04:54:50,3,en,2010-06-15 04:54:50,6,2010,0.00071,0.00012,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,209

I'd finish every third or fourth section and feel the emotion rise.

Victoria Anne,"I can definitely say that I've never read anything like Invisible Cities before. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are in a garden conversing. Polo describes numerous cities he has visited. The compilation of these descriptions are what make up this work. I am uncomfortable calling it a novel. It's more of a meditation. Whatever you label it, I enjoyed it. At first I thought it was rather strange. But after I sort of gave up trying to understand the subtext and instead just read, I found there were moments of crazy beautiful insight. The descriptions start to get a bit repetetive and the cities kind of were overlapping in my mind. In the end they lose their individualtiy and it is as if the cities are all a reflection of one place, one world, perhaps even one mind. I don't know if I can recommend this book, because I can't really describe it. Perhaps that in itself is a good description, as Gore Vidal has said, ""Of all tasks, describing the contents of a book is the most difficult and in the case of a marvelous invention like Invisible Cities, perfectly irrelevant.""

Daniel Hammer,"This book is full of poetic and beautiful imagery, but I'm not sure it is much more than that. It never captivated me in the same way that it seems to for most readers of Calvino's most famous book. Each short chapter is a description of an imaginary city as told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Khan himself, like the reader, questions whether these descriptions could possibly be real. Like the reader again, he seems to conclude that the reality of each place is not important, but rather the provocative ideas introduced by Polo, which allow him to reflect on his own empire.Despite this potentially interesting philosophical premise, the book never held its themes together for me, nor did it present any clarity on the vague issues Calvino seems to have wanted to introduce. I have a feeling that avid readers of this book are bringing more to the book than the book is bringing to them. I wanted ideas that, in a clear way, challenged me to think. What I found instead were hazy images that rather required more creative interpretation on my part in order for there to be anything on these pages at all.",2012-07-26 02:11:31,2,en,2012-07-26 02:11:31,7,2012,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,198

Less pedantic than Eco, less obscure than Borges, less preachy than Gibran, and yet for all the 'less' it has so much more. Dazzling, inventive, phantasmagorical...the discourse sparkles with understated elegance... ""'With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.''I have neither desires nor fears,' the Khan declared, 'and my dreams are composed either by my mind or by chance.''Cities also believe they are the work of the mind or of chance, but neither the one nor the other suffices to hold up their walls. You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours.''Or the question it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx.'""",2012-08-31 13:26:34,5,en,2012-08-31 13:26:34,8,2012,0.00156,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00021,0.00017,202

I asked for a copy for xmas so I can peruse some more; I want to think more about how it's structured.There's a lot of thematic stuff going on in a relatively slim book: the imperfect way our systems of signs (language, cities, games) describe reality, the nature of communication (between humans, or between a human and his own memory), the way past experiences (or our interpretations thereof) shape our current selves. It's perhaps not thematically shocking now, but it was probably pretty cutting end in the early 1970s, when post-modernism wasn't yet in the vernacular. My favourite cities: The endless suburbs; the chaotic one with the perfect, ordered carpet in the middle (which is the Platonic ideal?); the one with a completely different language of signs (e.g. the prisoners are held in the castle); the one so closely mimicking the stars that the stars much mimic it.

Attila,"The 13th century book about the journeys of Marco Polo is the record of an observant traveller visiting the cities of the exotic East. In Invisible Cities, the traveller describes imaginary places in the framework of a dialogue with Kubilai, the heir of Genghis Khan. Kubilai Khan does not attempt to know or understand the cities of the empire through a stranger's eyes; he is rather curious about the destruction that devours not only his country, but also the entire world. Marco Polo, on the other hand, wishes to understand the bonds and relations between people and places. Their discussion centers around themes like friendship, languages, cultures, progress, and empathy.Invisible Cities is not a novel or a collection of essays; rather a prose version of a poetry book Calvino had always planned to write but has never gotten to it. In the description of every fantastical city we can discover melancholic observations of modern society's problems and characteristics.

Kim Olson,"If you're looking for a book with a strong plot (or any plot), look elsewhere. This isn't that. What it is: a lyrical and thought-provoking read. The set-up is a series of conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, in which Polo describes various ""invisible cities"" sprinkled throughout the Great Khan's empire. Ersilia, with houses connected by strings that become so numerous and weblike that the citizens are ultimately forced out. Argia, where solid earth fills all the space where air should be. Esmeralda, which sounds a bit like Venice, if it had been conceived by Escher. Through his evocative and often poetic descriptions of these imaginary cities, Marco Polo explores a wealth of ideas--around architecture, culture, how humans live and organize themselves, death. The cities are imaginative, often bursting beyond the bounds of what might be physically possible, as he explores higher ideas and ideals. Polo's city descriptions are intertwined with his conversations with Kublai Khan, which further explore some of the same themes.

What's more, I feel this will be a future re-read, when in need of something otherworldly, something enlightening, and also some sense of continuity the next time I travel from place to place, city to city. This book is poetic (the imagery!!), but more importantly, wise and soulful. The interspersed conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Kahn, a bit meta-fiction and providing the merest filigree of a plot, was brilliant. As Marco Polo does much more than itemize the vast array of cities under Kublai Kahn's domain, Kublai Kahn learns to acquire much more than information. This book speaks to me on so many levels, especially as a foreigner, someone far from home, and also succeeds in shedding light on other grand themes, like the fallibility of memory, mortality, legacy, the environment, social connection, and semiotics, if you're into that.

Ville Halonen,"I read the Finnish translation, which is excellent Finnish and a joy to read; I'm not able to say anything about the accuracy, though.The book is ostensibly about cities. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan discuss about Polo's travels and the cities he has seen. Each city gets a page or so, three at the most, and they're highly allegorical little tales at times bordering on prose poetry. It's a difficult book to describe, and sometimes to read, as well, but it is very inventive, imaginative, and impressive as well. Be warned that there are effectively no characters whatsoever in this book.I felt it did lack emotional oomph, though, but it just might be me. There's so much stuff going on this book that maybe subsequent readings reveal additional layers and the needed emotional impact. This time it felt very cerebral, and the postmodernity of it was a tad tiresome at times.

Jeff Rowe,"I wish to become a disciple of whatever religion has adopted “Invisible Cities” as its holy book. First off, it’s really a joy to read. Only one or two self contained pages devoted to each city. Furthermore, the presentation of city classifications is cyclical in a way I haven’t bothered to figure out. Perhaps there’s some hidden meaning or reason for this. Whatever. The most enjoyable part is that, while you’re reading city descriptions, you slowly realize that the cities are just allusions for expressing truths about people, society, the world and the universe. As you traverse city after city, you don’t necessarily gain knowledge, but more like enlightenment. Sort of like hacker koans. This is how people are, this is how they perceive the world, this is how they interact, and this is how the universe is. I will admit that it gets a little repetitive after awhile. I subtracted one star for that. But the beauty is that this book isn't just good for reading linearly in one sitting.

By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present.

Jeremy Goldstein,"I've never had alot of success with magical realism, and I found Invisible Cities as confusing and occasionally stupifying as other attempts have made me feel. However, I enjoyed this all the same. The premise of the book is simple: Marco Polo telling Kublai Khan about all the cities he's seen in Khan's crumbling empire. Each place is fantastic in its own way, and Calvino clearly has a story he's trying to tell, which is helped along by interspersed dialogues between Polo and Khan. Without those dialogues I would've given up on this book, however short, almost immediately. But those dialogues often helped ground the story, and as a simpleton I desperately needed them. After finishing, I found out that this story is based to some degree on The Travels of Marco Polo, a book given the nickname Il Milione, reputedly because of the million lies of exaggeration told by Polo when describing Khan's realm.

I felt as though there was something I just wasn't ""getting"" (I seem to become stupider as I get older), and had trouble getting into the book.But slowly, the cities start to intermingle, and compose a structure. The concepts and ideas build on one another from vignette to vignette, referencing one another and creating extended ideas. As you read deeper, the metaphors become richer and more intricately layered, and it's easy to see how the pieces are connected.The language is evocative and well-chosen--it'd be interesting to read in its original Italian. Calvino mixes mythology, philosophy, and sociology in a way that reads like a fairy tale and makes me think I've been transported to exotic cities (whether real or imaginary, alive or dead).

Arnold,"brilliant. brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.Kublai Khan and Marco Polo!a description of the human condition through the eyes of the traveler and the cities he traverses. Heavy stuff, yet so light.One of my (many many many) favorite passages in the book (which in the grand scheme of the book is actually somewhat inconsequential, as is almost everything else in the book when observed on its own) involves Kublai Khan's observation that despite the numerous cities Marco has described, he has shied away from one very important one, Venice, Marco's very city. Marco replies that perhaps he's only been describing Venice. Italo immediately dives into something else leaving this insight hanging (his attempt at lightness?). And of course it feels less profound until you remember that Italo is from Italy. I don't think he's from Venice, but I'm sure his Italian identity was foremost in his mind when he wrote that particular passage (perhaps even when he conceived of the project)Ok I never write reviews this long. Go read the book and be amazed.",2008-07-30 03:22:38,5,en,2008-07-30 03:22:38,7,2008,0.00067,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,171
James Henderson,"This is a dense and fascinating book and while it is complicated on many levels, there are at least three themes that stood out for me: first, the nature of power and the cycle of life, death and rebirth; the illusion of happiness; and the power of language; second, the theme of travel being the source of imagination; and third, the theme of self-discovery.Marco Polo tells tales of places he's been to the Great Khan, who at first takes them literally. Only later does he begin to suspect there's more to the stories, and the reader begins to do the same. The cities are dreams, or at least imagined landscapes, and recognizing this is the key to that third-level theme, self-discovery. If the tales are all imagined, they must tell us something about Marco Polo, which must tell us something about ourselves. Once we understand this, the purpose of the book becomes clear. It's a meditation on humanity. It's all there, parables about political power, warnings about the use and abuse of language, lessons about time and the raising up of awareness and social conscience.",2009-03-01 20:45:11,5,en,2009-03-01 20:45:11,3,2009,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,185
Jason,"One of Calvino's more beautiful works. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite, but Calvino definitely reaches a poetic pitch unmatched in the other works of his that I've read.In Invisible Cities, Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of his travels to all of the cities in Khan's empire, only he is not describing real cities. Each city description is a dreamlike prose poem imagining all the possible forms that a city, or every city, may take. Khan understands that Polo is making it up as he goes along, but he also realizes that each description of a city reveals some truth about every city and about life.The gist of all of the city descriptions is Calvino's basically subjective philosophy of life. But the philosophy is not the reason to read the book. Some of the chapters are downright enchanting, and I found myself rereading several chapters multiple times. The translation is excellent. I've had a hard time tracking down a reasonably priced copy in the original Italian, but iTunes does have an abridged audio version, which is very nice. The language is simply marvelous.",2009-09-12 04:33:01,5,en,2009-09-12 04:33:01,9,2009,0.00065,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,184
Adam,"Invisible Cities is the second Italo Calvino book I’ve read. The first, If on a Winters Night a Traveler was absurdly overwritten and all around terrible. Calvino does not redeem himself here, despite the excessive overall praise for the novel.Oddly enough, I don’t think – on a visceral level – that Invisible Cities is all that bad. Through descriptions of each city, Calvino offers insights into the human psyche and some are really moving. Unfortunately, I cannot praise Invisible Cities for the same reason I could not praise If on a Winters Night a Traveler: it’s so. unbelievably. pretentious.Honestly, I get the idea that Calvino sat down at his desk and said to himself, “Italo – you are going to create the best, most insightful, unique book ever to be written.” In essence, the entire novel stinks of too much effort. The city descriptions become redundant and boring; the dialogue between Kahn and Polo is, well: naff.I was unbelievably let down by Calvino, and it will be a long time until I pick up another one of his novels. Books should be organic not forced.",2009-11-17 23:04:27,2,en,2009-11-17 23:04:27,11,2009,0.01578,0.00013,0.00107,0.00019,0.00104,0.00037,185
Adam,"As much extended passages of prose poetry as it is a novel, Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities is an extended conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, in which Polo describes many, many cities to the emperor. The descriptions are, at turns, beautiful, tragic, moving. What's more, Calvino posits the question of a city's existence, in fact the existence of anything, in that it can only be known in particular instances, that memory crystallizes existence without a future or a past, yet the future and the past effect all of these crystallizations.Also, the fact that most of the cities are given female names, it's interesting to consider the correlation between the city and the individual that feels the impact of it. His descriptions are just vague enough, just fluid enough to correspond to knowledges and truths of the inner workings of the human mind. Calvino loves to connect the literary with the unconscious, the physical with the metaphysical, often to the tipping point of comprehension.",2010-08-07 12:56:05,4,en,2010-08-07 12:56:05,8,2010,0.00072,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,164
Owen,"Don't think you're starting an ordinary novel or you'll be very frustrated. If you allow the book to take you on a journey and remove your expectations, it a rewarding read. It's a series of descriptions of cities with snippets of dialogue inserted at various places. The descriptions are like poems, often with impossible idiosyncrasies of all of the residents or the cities themselves. The descriptions are laid out in a mathematical sequence but follow no narrative pattern. The dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan often make you wonder about what you are actually reading. You can ponder truth, perspective, storytelling, reality or myriad other concepts over this book or simply enjoy the writing. The writing is beautiful. I read it in small chunks as each description got me busy processing the concepts and visualizing exotic places. This is a book to return to, a book to own. However, it's not a book for everyone as the lack of conventional structure is disorienting.",2012-08-04 21:55:19,4,en,2012-08-04 21:55:19,8,2012,0.00091,0.00011,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,164
Matt,"There isn't a whole lot of story behind this one. The basic premise is that Kublai Khan is asking Marco Polo about all of the cities he has been too. There are snippets of the two of them discussing, cities, empires, and travels, but it is mostly philosophical discussion. The majority of the book is Marco's description of cities. At first he starts with what seems like average descriptions of average cities. But as he progresses the descriptions get more and more metaphorical.The book is kind of a philosophical review of travel writing. It discusses how cities are perceived by those who visit vs those who live there and an extensive self review by Kublai and Marco on how a person perceives life in general. It also has some great descriptions of wildly fantastic cities, and some wildly fantastic descriptions of what could be any city.Calvino killed it with Baron in the Trees and this was masterfully written. Definitely an author worth checking out if you like creative ideas, metaphors and great writing.",2012-12-22 12:40:26,4,en,2012-12-22 12:40:26,12,2012,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,173
Lark,"Italo Calvino is a genius of a writer. I absolutely adore his writing. Even midway through the book, all I could think was wow, wow, I love this, wow. It's in the feel of the writing, it's in the ambiance he creates with his words. There is a sense of longing and mystery and just the feel of a person sitting down with a mug of something steaming in his hands, closing his eyes and letting the steam wash over his cheeks. Invisible Cities is such a beautiful book for the possibilities it evokes in the mind. These snipbits of cities are endless possibilities waiting to be unraveled. The conversations between the the Khan and Marco Polo are a hint of the past and the theme that ties the book together.I adore this book. I will have to come back to it.It is not an easy read. It is not a book to skim through and be done. Each little paragraph is an entire city, each little paragraph is a city of thought to be discovered.

Jamie,"I think if I reread this, I would give it five stars. But one read is not enough to wrap your head around it. It's far more satirical and abstract in a (excuse my throwing this word around) post-modern kind of way than 'if on a winter's night a traveller'. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I appreciate it now like I would after a second reading.======================Based on the above, is it reasonable to say I'm psychic? Or perhaps even four years ago, I knew myself as a reader pretty damn well. Upgraded to a five-star rating after a much-overdue reread. I don't know why I described Invisible Cities as ""satirical"", because that assessment now seems way off. It's definitely abstract, in a very dreamlike way. So much of it is rooted in the imagery and other sensory descriptions, that it's almost impossible to explain this book to someone else. It's an experience to be had, not necessarily a story to be told.In any case, I will definitely be rereading this again, hopefully before 2021.",2013-04-26 19:02:23,5,en,2013-04-26 19:02:23,4,2013,0.00138,0.00012,0.00038,0.00011,0.00019,0.00013,176
Eric,"A quick read, but one that may just stay with you for a long while afterwards, easily pulled of the shelf and re-read. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan take turns describing cities of the realm while lounging around, presumably smoking various opiates (these scenes book-end each cluster of city descriptions). The cities are all imagined (or... are they?!), certainly the names are none that exist on this planet (or... are they?!). Well, plenty of parable and metaphor to go around. You start to wonder if they aren't describing cities (that are, were or could be) so much as various human conditions. Each city description is typically no longer than 2 pages. You may not always really understand what the heck you're reading (some descriptions are so fantastical, the cities impossible, paradoxical), but they are well written and beg afterthoughts. I can't really add more that everyone else on Goodreads hasn't already said, but I enjoyed the book and I'm sure you will too.

Liem Duong,"The scope of this book is ginormous in relation to how small the paperback is! Marco Polo describes each city he crossed in vivid detail to his host Kublai Khan. The details describing those cities are so vivid and colorful, one can simply open the book at a random page, pick up a pencil and sketch that city precisely as it is portrayed in Marco Polo's mind. Reading ""Invisible Cities' continuously could be exhausting at times. The book would challenge my imagination and I had to take breaks in between chapters to recharge that 'mental workspace'.My favorite parts of ""Invisible Cities"" are Marco Polo's philosophical conversations with the great Kublai Khan.ei: Marco Polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. ""But which is the stone that supports the bridge?"" Kublai Khan asks. ""The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,"" Marco answers, ""but by the line of the arch that they form."" Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: ""Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."" Polo answers: ""Without stones there is no arch.""",2014-12-15 03:58:01,4,en,2014-12-15 03:58:01,12,2014,0.00069,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00015,187
Ian H.,"I don't feel like giving the books a star rating anymore, if I don't like them then I won't add them to this site. So assume that any book I put here is one that I enjoyed reading. INVISIBLE CITIES is a really beautiful book, structurally innovative. The things I liked about it: the book consists of fifty-five prose poems describing cities. The descriptions are framed by conversations between the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and the Venetian explorer Marco Polo. MP describes his travels through the empire of KK, although the cities are fantasy-scapes and as the book progresses the discourse between MP and KK becomes more and more esoteric.I love the book because I love cities. I have traveled to maybe thirty or fifty major cities across Asia and Europe in the past three years and I am so drawn to the unique ways in which every city constructs an identity for itself. Identities that are constantly evolving and mutating. Beyond the poetic beauty of the description bits, this book also contains some really great insights into urbanity and travel and memory and symbolism and identity.",2015-05-05 10:44:30,0,en,2015-05-05 10:44:30,5,2015,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,0.00017,0.00015,187
Meredith Englund,"I really wanted to love this, but I think I'll have to circle back and read it when (if?) my attention span is a bit better. It's a book comprised of tiny (1-2 pages) descriptions whimsical cities, or whimsical descriptions of cities. It doesn't flow on as a story so much as pieces of a larger story about people and their relationship with their environment, framed as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. I would have had an easier time reading this if I didn't have to look up every 10 words and if I hadn't read the bulk of it on the noisy train, but it did remind me I need to brush up on my vocab. It's a short book, but I found myself re-reading passages because I'd get lost in tangential thought, or because I was particularly attracted to the descriptions. I remembered loving The Baron in the Trees by Calvino, so I picked this up - I'm not disappointed, but I wish I felt more capable of focusing on this one. I'll circle back around when my reading habit is stronger and give this a thorough shot in one or two sittings (how I feel it's meant to be read).",2015-12-23 03:05:27,4,en,2015-12-23 03:05:27,12,2015,0.00056,0.00013,0.0002,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,206
Brian,"A collection of dreams or poems or Zen koans, about cities that may or may not have existed outside of the imagination. This book teases the reader – enrapturing the reader who loves a grand mystery, and torments the reader who demands satisfaction. Don’t expect these cities or the path between them to “make sense,” in the conventional sense. This is not the kind of novel that you want to barrel through from beginning to end. If you go from city to city in a hurry, you will miss out. Better to take your time. Read a little bit each day – a city in the morning, another before lunch, and keep the book by your bedside. This is a good book to savor over the course of a week or several, while spending most of your reading time on another book that you can attack in a linear fashion from beginning to end.There are cities that I wanted to visit, to live in, or to write stories that flesh out and inhabit these cities.I don’t know that I could tell you what the point is, of this book.

Erik,"What an interesting book. I must admit, I actually did not read the entire thing. Eventually the chapters, all exceedingly short, blended together, and I continually failed to grasp the significance of each description of yet another fanciful city, one after another, described by Marco Polo for Kublai Khan. Yet I did not think this act was a failure, for the book is not a story per se and has no arc; it is not even episodic; it is a series of images. Yet each image has a focal point, or a point not to be seen. I picked up this book as it is apparently a favorite of Father Gabriel's. Taking a cue from one of his homilies, before I closed the book for the last time, I turned to the last page. I think that made the book worthwhile. When we find ourselves in the inferno of life, we can take the easy path and be consumed by it, or we can take the risky path that is ""risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not the inferno, then make them endure, give them space.""",2016-01-12 00:31:29,3,en,2016-01-12 00:31:29,1,2016,0.00077,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015,202
Molly McCarty,"This is a weird and wonderful little book of experimental fiction that reads like poetry. In it, Marco Polo is telling Kaublai Khan, an emperor, about the cities he has visited. At some point it becomes clear to Kublai that he is, in fact, describing the same city over and over again. the book consists of tiny, poetic ""chapters"" that are the descriptions of this city. The context seems a fairly obvious literary device, similar to the walls of a home: it allows life to be contained within. Each chapter is delightful adventure of the senses. This line, above all, encapsulates the enchanting quality of this book: ""There is a sense of emptiness that comes over us at evening, with the odor of the elephants after the rain, and the sandalwood ashes growing cold in the braziers, a dizziness that makes rivers and mountains tremble on the fallow curves of the planispheres"".",2017-02-07 05:59:19,4,en,2017-02-07 05:59:19,2,2017,0.00072,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,152

Tom Meaney,"Marco Polo is a dreamer. He fascinates Kublai Khan with vivid descriptions of far off, fantastical cities. Interspersed between these descriptions, the explorer and the emperor sit in palace gardens and converse. We learn that Marco is potentially describing every possible city, perhaps ones he's never been too, perhaps all inspired by his hometown of Venice and perhaps cities that have never existed. This puzzling theme brings the reader face to face with infinity. Marco has never been there, yet he knows the way and can describe the streets and the bridges, the architecture, the culture and the attitudes of the residents in detail. Is he speaking these places into existence? Or is he describing what has been forgotten? Or what is yet to be? I genuinely have no idea. If anyone figures it out, let me know.This book doesn't have a real beginning or end, like a polyhedron.

Hansel5,"I learned about this title from an online interview I read where a Cuban architect quotes or mentions this book. The architect alluded to the fantastic imaginary, a prevalent theme in Cuban literature, that one can find in this book; that it can serve as inspiration to architects.In the book Marco Polo is summoned by Kublai Kahn to visit cities in his vast empire and report back particularities about each one. Each city is described by Polo in fantastical terms as eccentric, almost supernatural urban fantasies. Some cities exist for a limited period of time only to lie dormant again after a cycle. Other cities transform incessantly like micro organisms. There were two cities which caught my attention and intrigued me as places I would like to visit, in reality or in that fantastical imaginary.The great Kahn listens to the storytelling, but is not quite sure what Polo tells him is real or if he is creating each city out of his imagination.

I know that this will be a book that I should read a year or two from now, to see what else comes of it. It was a tougher read than ""If on a winter's night a traveler"" due to how short each description of each ""city"" was. Then again, his intention was to give us literary postcards. There were some passages that were absolutely lovely.

Emily,"Part satire, part philosophy, part poetry, I love the way this book provokes my mind to wander. Sitting in a garden, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo engage in a conversation--which may actually simply be imagined by both of them--in which Marco Polo describes the fantastical cities of his voyages. Over the course of the book, it is revealed that all these cities are actually the same city. Literally, they are Venice, but they are also cities of the mind, and each imagination-sparking description takes its turn in commenting on, among other things, time and change; perspective; the necessity but unreliability of memory; human desire and striving; the instinct to name and categorize; repetition and monotony; and suburban sprawl and the choking off of nature. I have read dull and wordy books that address all of those topics separately, so I tip my hat to Calvino, who accomplishes this in a mere 165 imagery-packed pages.",2007-11-27 23:49:45,5,en,2007-11-27 23:49:45,11,2007,0.00183,0.0001,0.0002,0.00011,0.00022,0.00018,154

Scott,"An almost free-form meditation on how we perceive our world and how we create meaning around us. Whether a cognitive scientist could do better to capture the various methods and ways we understand, order, and attempt to control our surroundings (urban or otherwise) than Calvino could with this slim tome of what I would consider almost prose poetry, I am not sure. Symbols, words, sounds, expressions, movement, music - what else do we have to communicate space and memory to one another? Calvino explores our human repertoire and sketches the limitations of perfectly transferring meaning and experience. This book brings to mind the limitations inherent in Plato's conceptualization of the ideal, for how to convey even simple ideas across continents? between civilizations or cultures? Is there a universal ideal? If someone like Plato cannot convince me of a universal standard of beauty, Calvino's volume expresses its ineffability.",2011-03-18 08:46:21,5,en,2011-03-18 08:46:21,3,2011,0.0007,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,147
Moonquake Abbott,"A book impossible to review with a synopsis of any kind. Truly a testament, in this sense, to the eclectic treatment of its subject matter of cities. Although the guiding thread is a set of encounters between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, the reader's experiences and reactions are the true yardstick by which this book is measured. As one of the better quotes in a book replete with good quotes says, ""It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.""Open your ears and experience for yourself the world Calvino helps his readers create. On a side note, if you're interested in getting a good idea of how talented Calvino is as a writer, I'd recommend you read ""The Path to the Spider's Nest."" The novel, Calvino's first, is very Italian neorealist in a way that starkly contrasts with later works such as ""Invisible Cities.""

Marcella,"Calvino is one of those writers that you feel compelled to read out loud (kind of like fitzgerald). And he is someone who writes both lyrical and concise, as if each chapter of this book were a poem that evoked the vision of a different city. He weaves the past with the present, so that even though Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are conversing, some cities are modern and others more ancient and all likely made up. There is suspicion that all the cities are one city - but its almost like cities are not being described at all, but relationships. An analysis of humanity and our connection to stories and each other and how the places we visit or imagine somehow reveal outselves.Perfect to read while traveling (this is so short that I finished it in one plane ride from Denver to Chicago) and contemplating the definitions and descriptions of cities you've been and whether they are actually just reflections on yourself.",2011-11-02 11:02:16,4,en,2011-11-02 11:02:16,11,2011,0.0006,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,163
Bryan Boulette,"I really have not read much Italian literature. Setting aside Umberto Eco, I think I have to go back to Niccolo Machiavelli in the 15th century, and before him, the triumvirate of Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch in the 14th to come up with Italians with whose works I am familiar. It's not exactly a rich background. So perhaps that contributes to why Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities feels so refreshing. Or maybe the strength of his elegant, lyrical, and highly evocative prose poetry (an underused art form in literature) stands completely on its own, fantastic even when divorced from its cultural background. Either way, this is an absorbing collection that imagines up descriptions of fantastical cities during a string of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, but the cities are so often merely a pretense for the amusing observations about philosophy and human nature that are at the heart of Invisible Cities.",2012-03-10 23:32:47,4,en,2012-03-10 23:32:47,3,2012,0.00066,0.00012,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,152
matt harding,"Probably the most amazing and perplexing book I have ever read. The size and the short narrative vignettes are deceptive because the book holds all manner of (im)possible worlds and combinations of meaning. I think that Calvino's short essay from The Road to San Giovanni, titled ""From the Opaque"" is one text that shines a light on this book, but you will have to read it to agree or disagree with this statement. I will say that I think that the narrator of the essay is having some fun with Mandelbrot's coastline paradox, while he extends the metaphor at the same time. I can also see a truncated deep map and perhaps a little nod to Gadamer's fusion of horizons. It seems that I have spent more length sketching out inferences in ""From the Opaque"" in a review that was supposed to conjure up Invisible Cities, which means I've created a bit of an homage to the book with this brief gesture, and that's perfectly fine by me.",2012-06-24 08:56:42,5,en,2012-06-24 08:56:42,6,2012,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,168
Dorothee Lang,"The author of ""Invisible Cities"" is Italo Calvino, who was born in Cuba and grew up in Italy. A web friend of mine read his ""Winter Night"" a while ago and recommended it, saying: ""..that book really wowwed me – it is a writer’s book, a book for writers.""The same Wow goes to Invisible Cities from my side. The book, on first glance brief, describes a fictive ongoing conversation between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, which includes 55 portraits of imaginary cities, and each city reads like a zen riddle that hints at society, architecture, the shapes we form to live in. Both a metaphorical and philosophical book, it also adresses the nature of journeys - and of language.(this is part of a longer review that also includes some other related books, here: Currently Reading: Invisible Cities, Forgotten Highways",2012-08-15 05:02:44,0,en,2012-08-15 05:02:44,8,2012,0.00063,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,139
Collette,"Throughout my studies of cities, preservation, and nostalgia, this work occasionally came up in conversation. Unfortunately, I never had the time to read it until now (which is incredibly silly because it's quite a short read). This book presents a conversation, rather many conversations, between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan, where Polo describes for Khan the many different cities within Khan's empire. Two of the descriptions, Phyllis and Irene, struck me most (though I think this will be different for each reader, as we are impacted by cities in individual ways). The story of Phyllis I viewed as a reminder to not become complacent in your daily life, to always view your city with fresh eyes as so many times we glaze over and stop looking at the things we see everyday simply because we see them everyday. Remember that, with cities, everything imaginable can be dreamed. Marco Polo shows how important and true this is.",2013-03-14 06:58:45,4,en,2013-03-14 06:58:45,3,2013,0.00064,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,156

Marco Polo recounts to Kublai Khan his voyages to a multitude of fantastical cities. Calvino is regarded as the premier fabulist, and it's easy to enjoy his imaginative prose. His descriptions run the gamut: whimsical, stolid; dreamy, philosophical.Less clear is his purpose (Inscrutable Cities, amirite?). To take a stab: I think Calvino exults the human imagination while suggesting that, in spite of these free-flowing voyages of the mind, we are grounded creatures -- with an origin and a home.",2013-06-08 05:06:47,4,en,2013-06-08 05:06:47,6,2013,0.00109,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00019,0.00015,148
Sancho,"This book is about a conversation between Marco Polo and the Tartar Emperor Kublai Khan. The latter continuously questions Marco Polo about the cities that the explorer has visited in his vast kingdom. Marco Polo describes both real and immaginary cities. The book is written as a collection of short poems referring to different topics such as desire, death, or signs. The characters speak different languages, so they do not understand each other, other than through their own interpretation of what the other says.I think the book is entertaining. The author describes all these places; how they look, who lives there, what locals do, the smells, the animals, etc.I do not give it many stars because it is just not my favorite literary style. However, I recognize the richness of the narrative and the language the author uses, and can see why so many people find inspiration in the book (even architects and urbanists).",2013-09-20 01:18:11,2,en,2013-09-20 01:18:11,9,2013,0.0006,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,154
Kevin Vognar,"This is a strange sort of book, a series of images and ideas, descriptions of fictional cities that are all just slightly fantastic in nature. I think it's a book I needed to read right now - though each city is given only a fleeting glimpse, each one is enough to give you a sense of the place, and overall the book helps develop an understanding of how every city (real or fictional) has its own distinct qualities, how architecture and climate and subtle things like the layouts of streets can change the culture and psychology of a city's citizens.You can't really notice the quirks of your home town until you've left, but this might be enough to start you looking at your home in a new light, and is certainly an encouragement to go traveling.I'll need to put more thought into how I build my own fictional settings as well, now.

Archit Taneja,"The (imaginary?) cities are described using themes like the infinitely large and the infinitesimal, forked up time and space, the cohesive and the non-sticky. These seem like familiar tools used in magical realism; but the way they are tied to the essence of a city(whatever that is) really makes you look at them in a new way.The conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are quite something. It needs to be read a couple of times to get a hang of what they are talking about.The chapters in the book have interesting patterns. Some of these you figure out yourself, the more subtle ones you need to browse through Wikipedia.

Charlotte,"This book is closer to being a collection of poems than a continuous narrative. It's a musing on the interplay between cities' physical infrastructure and their inhabitants' culture and relationships, and is also an exploration of values, epistemology, and semantics. The imagery is beautiful and vivid; the ideas are thought provoking. I've tentatively given it 4 stars, but might raise it to 5 stars. It's a book to which I plan to return in the future.As my loving aunt Miloelm has pointed out, the imagery and language (at least, the language of this translation) are noticeably similar to those of Salman Rushdie's ""Enchantress of Florence,"" as are the portrayals of the kings, the foreigners, and the relationships between the kings and foreigners.

Tyrannosaurus regina,"Upon reaching the end of this book I am left with the thought, ""Now what was it <em>really</em> about?"" An oral atlas of unknown urban spaces, it is made up of wisdom and imagination and mystery and fragments of the known world, of philosophical ideas and questions about the nature of reality. Are they fantasies? Are they metaphors? Is the dreaming and telling of the travels the most important thing? Or, ultimately, is it all about this:“I speak and speak,” Marco says, “but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories.

Chava,"This book was on the reading list for a Bibliotherapy course I was going to take -- I bought the books and ended up not taking the course. Supposedly, every city Marco Polo describes is really Venice. I liked the idea of seeing so many aspect of one place in so many different ways, and for the most part I enjoyed the descriptions of people and places. Since the plot is basically Marco Polo telling Kublan Khan about cities he has visited or has imagined (sometimes the lines blur), it moved a little slowly for me. The thing I liked most is that it reminded me of Jerusalem -- I could walk around Jerusalem 1,000 times and always notice something new or different. I could be in the same place at different times of day and get a totally different feeling based on the light (or dark) and which people are there. I love how diverse the neighborhoods are.

Daniel,"I really don't know how to feel about this book. Compared to Se una notte d'inverno un viaggiatore, it was considerably less post-modern. However, it still had an unusual feel on account of not really being a book with a plot. It had beautiful scenery, and some of the descriptions were absolutely chilling, but I didn't love it as much as I've loved other books. It falls prey to the Moby Dick problem, for lack of a better name, where the beginning is really really good, but after 1/3 of the way through the book it loses steam and feels more like a chore than a leisurely read. The only thing I can definitely point to and say ""I didn't like this"" would be the blurb on the back, which kind of ruins the element of discovery in the book. I feel like I've had this problem with other books before, and may have even mentioned it before, but publishers need to stop spoiling the book in their blurbs.",2016-01-18 10:08:41,4,en,2016-01-18 10:08:41,1,2016,0.00076,0.00011,0.00019,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,169
Ericka Clou,"This very short novel is completely unique in that it is collection of stories about cities that are really ideas and feelings. The stories are tied together by an imagined conversation between Marco Polo, who is reporting on the cities, and Kublai Khan who is unable to venture out and explore himself.It's about memory, so it's interesting to reread it and see what I do and don't remember about the cities. The first time I read it was in 2010 while my dad was dying, and the city that stuck out was the one where ships sailed out and none returned. But in my reread I discovered this wasn't one of Marco Polo's cities but the Kublai Khan's dream, to which Marco Polo replies, ""Forgive me, my lord, there is no doubt that sooner or later I shall set sail from that dock,"" says Marco, ""but I shall not come back to tell you about it.

Bryan Schwartz,"I don't think I can offer a review of this ""book"" without falling to comparison. Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities reminds me of Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones. Both books are composed of surreal vignettes that are equal parts seductive, compelling, and bizarre. Like a kind of literary rock garden, Calvino's visions of imaginary cities felt like a meditative exercise and my mind often wandered. From what I have been able to ascertain, Italo intended that his readers would reflect on the complexities of linguistics and human nature. ...I probably thought about tacos. But that's neither here nor there. Unfortunately, as often happens in cases of translated texts, Invisible Cities is prosaically stilted. While I'm certain that Calvino's original showcases the beauty of Italian, it does not hold up as well in English and, for that, I'm inclined to dock a few stars.

Googoogjoob,"Each city in this book is like a thought experiment devised to illustrate an obscure and imaginary philosophical or theological problem. None of them mean a lot beyond themselves, and rather than thought-provoking or philosophically interesting, I found them most effective when considered as prose poems; the cities are too abstract to be considered concretely. The book has a dream-like rhythm to it, with the regular groupings of cities into numbered sections, then the rigid thematic patterning (although half the time the theme stated in the heading has a tenuous connection to the city described, if there is any connection at all), and within the stories there's a frequent poetic mechanism where several things, related or disparate, are listed in succession, and the juxtaposition of the items, whether people or exports or detritus, creates a dream-like gestalt impression which cannot be conveyed directly by words.

Recounts the features of city that many people will gloss over in their busy day to day lives but nevertheless have a hidden beauty if one stops to reflect and appreciate. It reminds me of a quote I heard, ""I think everywhere is a hidden treasure, it really depends on how present you are"" and what may seem simple or boring has an incredibly rich history underlying how it came to be. Some truly perspicacious insights are present in so many of the quotes of this book that I can’t even begin to list them but they provide a whole new perspective on cities, life, travel and the human condition.

Haneen Krimly,"It’s quite difficult to classify Invisible Cities because it’s neither a novel nor a short story collection. Rather, it’s a collection of vignettes talking about various urban and fictional cities.Calvino takes on the historical figures of Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Tartars, and Marco Polo, the Venetian traveler, and forms a fictional story in which Marco Polo is asked by Khan to visit various cities and report back on them. The result is an astonishing set of cities, all fictional and all bearing feminine names.The writing style is quite dream-like and sometimes poetic, but absolutely wonderful. Calvino makes you fall in love with cities in a way you’ve never experienced before.I recommend reading this book, as it offers valuable insights into what makes a city what it is.

Bryan,"I would like to make a statement that might be a no brainer for fans of this book. I listened to this as an audiobook and while I enjoyed it, this book deserves to be read. This book is more like poetry (the Prophet by Khalil Gibran comes to mind because there is an overarching narrative but the depth of the book lies in the poems) than a more straight forward narrative. Where you can jump from one chapter to the next with most audiobooks, I wanted to stop the audiobook and think about each city described. Like many poems, I want to stop and think about what I read and figure out what was hiding between the lines. Calvino accomplished something both whimsical and profound with this book that challenges the reader and defies the preconceptions of genres. It is a work of amazing creativity in concept and outstanding in its prose.

L L,"In this novel, Marco Polo describes to emperor Kubla Khan (spelling?) the various cities in the kingdom that he has conquered. What follows are short vignettes describing various cities, that hover somewhere in between real physical cities and ethereal metaphysical cities. Calvino seeks to describe different aspects of the personality, character and scope of cities—their changes, the way they make people interact, their relationship with other cities, with poverty, with corruption etc… This doesn’t quite carry the narrative cohesiveness or thematic clarity of say, Ray Bradbury’s Martian Chronicles. It is another case of a novel that reads better as poetry, or perhaps, as paintings or sketches.

Sarah,"Okay, let me start by saying that Calvino is a genius and I love his work. But books with no plot seriously put me to sleep. And if you start getting sleepy and glaze over for a page or two, in a book with no plot it won't matter. You could miss entire chapters, and you won't miss anything vital.The book is a serious of vignettes about different, somewhat magical, always-beautifully-described cities. My two favorites: the city that hangs on a net over a ravine, because the description of all those upside-down hanging houses and lives was really captivating.

Ted Burke,"Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino appeals to Universal wanderlust, the tourist who wants to transcend the visitor status and gathers an intriguing set of tales. Marco Polo telling tales of his travels to fantastic cities to Kublai Kahn, who is stupefied and enthralled, until he queries Polo of the veracity the tales, and the veracity of language, becoming, finally, a dialogue between not which representation is real, but which one is more useful in a scheme of things that presents itself only a line at time, charts on an unfolding map. Spinning tales of where one has been and what one did while they were there is an fine , delicately balanced craft where the plausible context and the impossible coincidence must balance each other in that strange space of gravity that keeps the reader in suspense, wondering what is real and what is of made up of whole cloth",2010-04-17 04:30:05,4,en,2010-04-17 04:30:05,4,2010,0.00065,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,150
Rebecca,"What I liked:p 82 Marco polo describes a bridge, stone by stone. ""But which is the stone that supports the bridge?"" Kublai Khan asks. ""The bridge is not supported by one stone or another,"" Marco answers, ""but by the line of the arch that they form."" Kublai Khan remains silent, reflecting. Then he adds: ""Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters to me."" Polo answers: ""Without stones there is no arch.""p 86 Dawn had broken when he said: ""Sire, now I have told you about all the cities I know."" ""There is still one of which you never speak."" Marco Polo bowed his head. ""Venice,"" the Khan said. Marco smiled. ""What else do you believe I have been talking about?"" The emperor did not turn a hair.

Chris,"a magnificent feat of the imagination, calvino creates a space/time-warping conceit of a conversation between kublai khan and marco polo, polo describing to khan the cities of khan's empire, that uses metaphors of geography and urban landscape to touch upon the entire system of the human imagination. the wonder of the novel is not in the coherence of the world it creates--it is left unanswered whether polo is really describing one city or many, whether these cities are supposed to exist, whether khan can understand at all the stories polo is telling him--but rather in the teetering scaffolding of images constructed, reflecting deeply philosophical thoughts. like a snapshot of a city, the novel seems densely compact, often illogical, and sublime, offering at each of its thin, skyscraper-like sections a world of meaning.",2010-12-26 05:22:34,4,en,2010-12-26 05:22:34,12,2010,0.00069,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,132
Lolo S.,"I didn't know how to read this book: each chapter is a city, the description of which is a page or so long. I wasn't sure if I should slowly, carefully examine each city as a precious gem or if I should read through voraciously to see how each tied to its neighbors. Sometimes I did both, sometimes I went back and reread. Calvino has managed to put only beautiful words on each page. I imagined that Calvino made a list of the world's most enchanting words, then built his cities by combining them: solstice and equinox, bristling, encrusted with serpentine, crevices where roots twist, and then allowed the stories to grow up around the words.Overall, just lovely.

Irene,"Calvino is a master craftsman. It was tough to start; eventually it really grew on me because of its sheer descriptive beauty, but I'll have to come back to this book again when I can appreciate it more (read: when I'm not in a post-thesis mad dash for anything with a sustained narrative). The frame story was the weakest part; it is why I have given it 4 stars rather than 5. I really like the way he blurs time, describing a couple of cities with buses and airports alongside all those that could possibly exist in Kublai Khan's time. And just how linked all of the cities are as evidenced in many of the cities, including Irene. The unity of the human experience in cities is definitely explored here.Favorite Cities (in order of appearance):ArmillaSophroniaAdelmaEusapiaIrene (for obvious reasons, also it is an ambivalent description though a good one)",2011-05-23 09:38:29,4,en,2011-05-23 09:38:29,5,2011,0.00062,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,148
Andrew,"One of my top-five favourite books. Each small chapter—a page or two—in a deceptively slight book, contains poetic prose describing different cities. The cities are being described by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. The great Khan ruminates in his luxurious palace about his vast empire and about how there are no more worlds to conquer. He asks Marco to tell him about the many places he has traveled beyond the Khan's dominion. Marco spins out his mesmerizing visions of cities, but he is really only telling a tale of one city: Venice—Marco's home. Each city described represents an aspect of Venice, both in specifics and in the universal qualities of all cities.

We had our guys in prison read the first chapter just to see good use of descriptive language and creating emotion rather than explanation when describing scenes. It was all a scheme to help them in their Shakespeare performance. Sadly, it never really came together. Still I read the rest of the book just because I liked it so much. Very good writing. It is just a series of descriptions of ancient (and some not ancient) cities being described to Kublai Kahn by Marco Polo. It's hard to describe.

Matt Brockwell,"Reading this book for the second time, twenty years after I read it for the first time, and realizing that the enchantment of it only grows deeper with time. It's hard to believe how much of it went over my head when I read it two decades ago; but maybe that is a testament to the maturity of the concerns that Calvino addresses. In the end, each of the cities is really a parable about the self; and Calvino's real game is to hold up a series of mirrors that let us ponder our own yearnings, hopes, mortality, and limits. He does so in language that is lucid and precise; his command of the large and the small is truly awe inspiring. He can paint large canvases and he can paint miniatures. And at the end of his sequence of meditations, when all else vanishes into memory, the final gift he leaves is a lasting sense of hope and respect.",2012-09-04 02:06:44,4,en,2012-09-04 02:06:44,9,2012,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,160
Hans Ostrom,"One of my all time favorite books. The conception is genius: Kubla Khan wants to know what's going on in his massive empire. Marco Polo just makes a bunch of stuff up because --why not? The execution of the idea is so original, fanciful, incisive, and beautiful (I can only imagine how great it must be in Italian) that one is left astounded and richly entertained, and, like Toni Morrison, Calvino sees nothing wrong with entertaining, even as he spins one clever 2 page fiction after another, most of them displaying elements of fantasy and sci fi but none of them derivative. They're also parables about travel, social organization, desire, and--well, and everything. Gore Vidal loved the book, and he almost never liked a book he didn't write, and if he did, he wouldn't admit it. I mention this only to suggest how winning Calvino's wit and artistry are in this book.

The book is a description of 55 cities as told to kublia khan by Marco Polo while they sit in the garden of the khan's castle, the book has no plot but calvino used almost a mathematical structure in categorizing the cities. From the beginning the reader can tell that those cities are not real but imaginitive in fact they may even be models for Polo's mental states of mind or are they simply different views of his beloved city Venice.

Andrada,"A few people I know highly praised Invisible Cities which I suppose increased my expectations of it. Because of it, I was a bit disappointed by what it actually turned out to be. I think the best way to describe it would be poetry in prose. It has similar affectations and imagery. It is by no means a novel, but more of an aesthetic and philosophical exploration of the notion of cities. Ahistorical, illuminating at its best, repetitive at its worst, I had trouble connecting with its ideas which probably means they don’t align to my own thoughts on the subject. Having seen many cities myself, I was interested how such a work could capture their essence and I thought his idea of a single city(whether one known or a core city) serving as a default starting point for all cities quite poignant. Beyond that though, there was not much that particularly resonated with me.",2013-11-19 09:58:19,2,en,2013-11-19 09:58:19,11,2013,0.00052,0.00014,0.0002,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,155

There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it.

Meltha,"This book has the quality of a fever dream. Description is very strong, and symbolism is dripping from every possible thing, but nothing quite makes sense. Essentially, Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of many, many different cities (or maybe it's all one city, or maybe all cities are one city, or maybe cities don't exist, or maybe Marco Polo and Kublai Khan don't exist, or they are they city... etc.). That's it. I'm not entirely sure something isn't be lost in translation. Several reviews have pointed to a similarity to Jorge Luis Borge's work, and the quality of the writing is similar, but the lack of plot (and that's very purposeful here; the writer does not want there to be a plot, or characterization, or anything really resembling a traditional novel or even short story collection) didn't really work for me.",2014-06-14 08:04:36,3,en,2014-06-14 08:04:36,6,2014,0.00064,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,141

Serge Pierro,"Although considered one of Calvino's greater works, I had expected more from this book. Sadly, I had read ""Einstein's Dreams"" several months earlier, and it clearly ""ripped off"" this book - both in structure and execution. Several of the worlds presented in ""Einstein's Dreams"" were far more interesting and thought provoking than the cities presented in ""Invisible Cities"", and while Italo Calvino was clearly a much better writer, I thought that ""Einstein's Dreams"" was a more interesting book. In this small book, Calvino unleashes his vivid imagination and spins tales of wondrous cities that are both interesting and varied in depth. And while his vocabulary is still prodigious, some of his trademark techniques are lacking here.

Benjamin,"Invisible Cities is one of the novels most synonymous with the name Italo Calvino so it seemed a good place to give the author a try. Unfortunately, I found it somewhat disappointing, though this is not so much the book's fault as it is mine. Given the lush, almost magical prose and storytelling this book should have appealed to me more, but something just never connected. Perhaps it was something to do with the layers of metaphors and figurative language describing the cities because I could never really figure out what it was trying to say. It was easier for me to connect to the interludes written by the third person omniscient narrator. Despite being disappointing, that doesn't mean I'll give up on Calvino.

Tim Fitzgerald,"Calvino's Invisible Cities takes the reader inside a labyrinth of Kublai Kahn's expanding empire. Kahn sets the well travelled trader and merchant, Marco Polo, on a journey to discover and recall the truth about each of his cities. Bizarre, eclectic, real and imagined findings unfold.I particularly liked the structure of this novel, much like a city, the reader feels altogether isolated and alone yet completely consumed by the intense descriptions and narration from Calvino's travelling character Marco Polo. Kublai Kahn and Marco Polo's dialogue is intellectual, intense and at times each of them are trying to out manoeuvre the other's idea of cities – tactics and strategies are cities erupting on a chess board. Truth becomes memory, memory becomes deceitful recollections, cities seem at once knowable and unknowable and all the while, expanding.

At some points, I struggled to understand what was happening, particularly the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan (though that's mostly because I'm terrible at philosophical stuff), but over all its very rewarding. It reminded me a lot of the Latin-American magical realism short stories I've read throughout my childhood, and it was fascinating to see the fluidity of time and space and how all these cities were defined or never defined and thus never are though they exist. It's an interesting conversation on how this Italian writer sees Venice and what it is to other people and all it could be and all it was.

However, I'm afraid the subtext was lost on me. Not in the way that I didn't understand it, but more so that it didn't really reach me.I enjoy the idea that the cities Marco Polo describes are not really physical cities, and I enjoy the concept of the listener determining what he wants to hear, more than what the speaker is trying to say. Maybe I'm not open minded enough, or maybe Calvino is too much of a poet for me, but I really wish I could read a book of his that has a beginning a middle and an end, character development and a clear plot.

Maryann,"Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are talking about where Polo has traveled, the cities he's seen. There are 55 in all, and the descriptions are minimal, a couple pages at most, a paragraph in some instances. This book feels like it's flitting around, just outside my grasp. First, how come almost all the cities have women's names? Is Polo making it all up to amuse Khan? What am I supposed to be taking away from this, other than the beauty of the language and the diversity of the world we live in? Maybe nothing... Food: a cup of miso soup.

Damian,"I think that this is a wonderfully written book; the short little vignettes of cities are lovely and the short connecting parts featuring Kublai and Marco Polo are philosophical without being overly wordy and difficult.Why 3 stars then? Purely because I'm not sure that it should be read as a novel in the way I did. I read it in a couple of sittings whereas I feel it would be better absorbing one short city tale as if it were a short story and then leaving time before reading the next. I suppose it's more like a poetry book then a novel. Read one or another dip in and out. Don't expect a solid cohesive plot, do expect a well written collection of essays about imaginary cities.

Some of these descriptions are insightful while others are inscrutable. The entire work is framed by a series of conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. This book has some deeper meaning and I intend to return to it when I'm in a more contemplative mood. However, at the moment the book is overdue and my desire to avoid a fine outweighs my desire to understand Invisible Cities.I respect what Calvino has done here, however that doesn't change the fact that this is a book in name only.

Neal,"Intriguing book that touches on deep philosophical musings through Marco Polo's descriptions of fictional cities to the emperor Kublai Khan. Although it appears to be set hundred's of years ago, many of the descriptions have contemporary references, such as airports and New York, thus giving it a timeless feeling. Each chapter is only a couple minutes long, and is either a description of a city, such as one that has a mirrored copy of itself underneath it where the dead go to continue a more idealized version of their life, or a conversation between the emperor and Marco Polo. Sometimes the descriptions get a tad confusing or hard to follow, but the ideas he portrays are very unique and can touch something quite profound.

It was a suggestion from an artist friend who sent out a call for work in relation to the book; ""Artists from across the USA and the globe have the opportunity to contribute a folio page to construct a new leporello book inspired by Invisible Cities, the novel by Italo Calvino.""So, on with the review. There really is no beginning and no ending... it is instead a view of what could have been the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublia Khan regarding the nature and visions of Marco Polo's travels. The conversations are sometimes sentimental and on occasion serious. Khan is in his decline and Marco Polo is entertaining him with his dream like stories.View my contribution to the project on instagram:gingert138"" x 8"" intaglio etching""describe the heavens""",2016-10-01 04:25:21,4,en,2016-10-01 04:25:21,10,2016,0.0007,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,139
B,"This was a great book. It was very short, and it didn't reveal much about the main characters (Marco Polo and Kublai Khan) - in fact it opened up many questions that the reader probably wouldn't have come up with on his own (such as: are Polo and the emperor actually in the garden while talking? Or are they even talking?) - but it provided so many unique observations on people and communities. I thought that many of the descriptions of the cities were excellent (and very discrete) commentaries on real-life characteristics of cities and of individuals in a communal setting. This is my favorite foray into magical realism so far (also read a few works of Marquez and Borges). I am definitely interested in not only reading some more of Calvino's works, but also coming back to this book at some time, because I feel that there are so many little subtleties that I missed on the first go round.",2016-11-13 13:36:46,5,en,2016-11-13 13:36:46,11,2016,0.00056,0.00013,0.00019,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,161
Julie  Capell,"Don’t read this book. Don’t read it if you have any illusions of being able to write decently yourself. Because you will immediately realize that you will never, ever be able to write even one sentence that is half as beautiful as any sentence written by Calvino.Don’t read it if you think you’ve ever had an original idea for a story. Because if you live to be 1,000 years old, you will never think of anything as unique as the ideas in this collection.Don’t read it if you want things you read to be neat and tidy. Because rather than a tight plot with a clear beginning, middle and end, this is a series of loosely connected concepts and philosophical ideas that is closer to Waiting for Godot than it is to any science fiction you have ever read.This little book blew my mind.

Tangled Tourista,"The one word which I can say about this book is, beautiful. The way Italo Calvino has described each and every city is nothing but just amazing. You may the find the city absurd, you may find it peculiar but the description will always remain wondrous.The book spoke to me on a different level. I found a message hidden in every city. Let’s say for example the city Fedora where in the building, there is one crystal globe in every room. And each globe shows a different Fedora, the one which it could have been. I feel that this is how our life is. We all face many choices and many paths, we choose one and we built our life the way it is today.

Viraj,"The book takes place as Marco Polo recounts his adventures through Kublai Khan's empire, to the emperor himself. The format is of several short (paragraph to 2-page-long) descriptions of (fictional) cities, interspersed with dialogue between Polo and the Emperor.At first the descriptions of the cities were a little too simplistic for me, and I was not too drawn in, but over the course of the book the tales of Polo's travels become more pithy and metaphorical, and I found many of these entrancing.At one point Khan asks Polo why he never speaks of his home city, Venice. Polo responds that all his descriptions of other cities are in fact descriptions of Venice--we describe our adventures in the context and contrast of our familiar homes.I would read this book again, especially on a trip to somewhere new.",2019-02-19 01:39:33,3,en,2019-02-19 01:39:33,2,2019,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,136

It's sort of wee and a pretty ideal little antidote for such an unpleasant place. Words thrown around about this book are 'surreal,' 'dreamlike,' and 'poetic'--and, yup, that's a big part of it. Not so much an engrossing narrative as it is a chance to visit some pretty magical imaginary worlds, it was my first crack at reading Calvino.

Irene,"I think to fully appreciate this book, you should approach it like you would a book of poetry: flip through the pages, and read only the passages that catch your mood.Unfortunately, I approached it like a novel... It has an interesting premise, and starts out well enough, but I admit that I got bored of it by the end. The book is basically a collection of one or two page descriptions of imaginary cities, the idea being that Marco Polo is describing the cities to Kublai Khan. Really, the book seems to be somewhat of a poetry / novel hybrid. One after another, fantastic and bizarre cities are described. Some of the cities are really quite inventive.

The streets are completely filled with dirt, clay packs the rooms to the ceiling, on every stair another stairway is set in negative, over the roofs of the houses hang layers of rocky terrain like skies with clouds. We do not know if the inhabitants can move about the city, widening the worm tunnels and the crevices where roots twist: the dampness destroys people's bodies, and they have scant strength; everyone is better off remaining still, prone; anyway, it is dark.From up here, nothing of Argia can be seen; some say ""It's down below there,"" and we can only believe them.

Douglas Summers-Stay,"Marco Polo describes imaginary cities to the Khan. Each city is basically a metaphor for a way of thinking. It's quite similar to Einstein's Dreams. If you've ever wondered whether a book could be nothing but scene description, give this a try. It's one of those books that has the body of nonfiction but the soul of fiction.The book made me want to find some kind of key to its interpretation. It's postmodern-- it is interested in questions of truth from particular perspectives, in playing games with levels of reality and the rules of literature. Part of the point is that all of the cities described are ways of looking at Marco Polo's home city of Venice.I also enjoyed Calvino's Cosmicomics, but not so much If On A Winter's Night a Traveler...",2009-06-05 21:16:50,4,en,2009-06-05 21:16:50,6,2009,0.00059,0.00012,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,132

Natanya Pulley,"This is a new favorite. The descriptions, structure and energy of this book is complex, but (for me) comforting. It's compromised of a couple page descriptions of different imagined (and yet what city isn't an imagined city and what imagined city isn't real?) cities. The frame story includes Marco Polo describing these cities to Kublai Khan. The cities are much like dreams, they have their own sense of logic. Cities are not just places, but systems or functions. It's hard to get a hold of what the cities are like ... there are some on stilts, one like water, two side-by-side like a mirror. I marked up the entire book with favorite lines and images.

The language is often beautiful, and the interaction between MP and KK is memorable. I find myself highlighting thoughts that are truly thought-provoking and profound. There is one chapter about the city Valdrada that evokes thoughts of our modern day obsession with recording everything and at what point are we living in the moment and when are we living in order to see how we looked in that moment.

There is no other way to describe it other than beautifully written and infinitely thoughtful. I already know a few people who I will be recommending it to and giving it to as a gift. The other thing that kept it from 5 stars was that I felt that it may have gone on a little long at the end. I was so taken with the Khan and Marco Polo that the cities at the end, though absolutely fascinating, especially the Continuous Cities, seemed to fade for me as I eagerly read to the next part in the garden.

Cora,"Invisible Cities was a different kind of novel. Instead of telling a story, the author tells many descriptions of imaginary cities. He presents it as Marco Polo describing cities from his travel's to Kublai Khan. Each city has the feel of a dream city with fantastical and/or philosophical elements. The reader is left wondering weather each city exists, if Marco Polo is making them all up, or if they are simply different ways of describing the same city or all cities. The writing is beautiful and often poetic. The images invoked are fantastic. Unfortunately, after the first few cities were described I started to find my attention wandering.

Adam Luptak,"Why did I enjoy this book - really, a collection of vignettes tied together with a loose story and thematic resonance - so much? Perhaps because I too, like the Kublai Khan of these pages, long to know more cities and foreign places than is possible to know.These vignettes are richly varied; some leave a strong visual impression, a singular image, while others are stories of peoples and their interactions. Some stories feel plausible for telling in the 1200s, and some are wildly anachronistic, speaking of airports and motorcycles and Ferris wheels. Throughout, the prose is thoughtful and lovely, painting thought-provoking portraits of places that can never exist and places that may always exist.",2013-02-09 13:56:07,5,en,2013-02-09 13:56:07,2,2013,0.00067,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,114

The surreal description of each city was kept brief and I easily rushed through them but then I would come back and reread the bits and pieces and ponder for five minutes trying to understand what Calvino tried to convey and how it could relate to me.If you are lost or at crossroads in your life, I would really suggest ""Invisible Cities"" since you very likely will find a key to yourself in one of the cities.",2013-03-29 00:55:41,5,en,2013-03-29 00:55:41,3,2013,0.00063,0.00013,0.00017,0.00015,0.00019,0.00015,147

Each city is described in a elegant prose poem that transports the reader to all manner of cities while after each chapter the Khan and Polo discuss various things relating to language, meaning and so on.On the level of its imagery alone, Invisible Cities is a pleasing book but it is more than that: it is an extended meditation on the meaning of city life and how man interacts with those around him. However, it also runs into periods where either Calvino is obfuscating deliberately or he is just being pretentious.

Marco Palo, the explorer, offers this insight to Kublai Khan, the conqueror, during an ongoing conversation within which Marco describes cities (the city) he remembers from his journeys.

Jimmy In,"The Mongol emperor Kublai Khan rules an empire that covers 10 million square miles. He sends his special emissary, Marco Polo, throughout his vast domain so he can periodically return and report on the cities he has visited. Marco's reports are more about cities as they exist in his imagination and what they can potentially become, than the bricks and mortar and wood they are built of. Marco also sees cities such as New York City that will be built in the future.

At first I liked hearing about the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan more than hearing about the cities Marco Polo described, but as both became more fantastical and it wasn't clear whether Marco Polo was actually traveling anywhere or if the two of them were even having a conversation, I got more enjoyment from the seemingly infinite varieties of cities Calvino conjured up. Through the absurd, sad, bizarre, and funny cities described to Kublai Khan, the reader is challenged to define what a city is — whether buildings or people, legacy and history or day-to-day reality.

"Tito Quiling, Jr.","I managed to finished this book while waiting for a friend this afternoon, and I read it again tonight. A good number of Italo Calvino's works are fast reads, but his language may be a bit complicated for a first time reader. However, the trick to getting through the words are going over them at a leisurely pace and feeling each drop. What I like about it is that it felt as though I wasn't reading a novel, but poetry. And describing the city is a poetic manner makes the city seem less harsh and intimidating. It also reveals its more intimate nooks that speak so much of how its inhabitants use them, and how transients tend to view them in their initial visit.

In all fairness, I was looking for good story and just picked this up because people compared him to Borges, so it was really my fault, but I am still giving it a four. Other than my being mistaken, it was a good book to read and I am better off having done so.

The author made me want to leave everything and travel through unknown worlds and explore the depths of my creativity. I honestly cannot tell you all the cities by name, or even describe them.

Beverly,"This is a strange little book. It only took me about 2 hours to read it. Although it was not a cohesive, straight-line story, I thought it was an interesting concept. Marco Polo and Kublai Khan are talking and Marco Polo is describing his extensive travels to Khan. Each city description takes only a couple of pages at the most and I found these descriptions well drawn. It was easy for me to visualize the cities and it's people. I am certainly not a literature scholar but it seemed to me that the intention of the book was that no matter where he traveled, people and places are basically the same even though widely divergent. All cities contained good elements and bad elements, artistic concepts and slovenly habits.

This book takes you on an exploration, describing cities in one or two pages using fabulous language and imaginative descriptions that get to the heart and soul of a place. It begins by having Marco Polo the explorer and Kublai Khan the conqueror face to face. Kublai Khan has conquered vast tracts of land, but has not been everywhere, to every city, and therefore has not seen all the invisible cities he technically has dominion over. Marco Polo, alternatively, owns nothing, but has explored to many exotic and different locales, adventuring and deducing the similarities and differences of these many cities.

I had to read this for an art class, but that shouldn't take away the gravity of the statement when I say ""Invisible Cities"" (to me) is the book form of an intricate, often confusing painting. The book is a visualization of how cities unfold and how they occupy space and time and feeling. The book doesn't feel like a conventional book at all--more like a long-winding flow of visuals.

So much descriptive and philosophical intent that it requires a rereading of many lines, searching and ruminating on details, like traveling to or inhabiting a city... so much to truly think on, including the meanings of it all. The conversations between Kublai and Polo seemed to have had a hypnotic effect on my own brain, so much so that I often could not distinguish between my own drifting ins or out of consciousness.

Moreso than most anything else I've read, stubborn snippets and passages refuse to recede. There's enough imagination and elegy throughout to make this worthwhile, and Calvino's particular style seems impossibly well suited to his topic: reflections on a vanishing age of splendor.

Jason Boyd,"Well, this is a strange one to review. Is it a novel or isn't it? I'm still not sure. Each chapter is very short - some of them only being a few paragraphs each - and they describe different cities that Marco Polo claims to have visited. He's telling this all to Kublai Khan.Admittedly, some sections were lost on me and would be worth reading over again, but all in all, I enjoyed this very short book and some sections have stuck in my mind since.Calvino's writing style is stunning (admittedly it's a translation but I'm assuming it's close to the original) and I'll be very interested in reading his other works, especially his other lauded 'If on a Winter's Night a Traveller.'",2013-05-02 00:29:36,4,en,2013-05-02 00:29:36,5,2013,0.00057,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,123
JP,"Picasso and Escher, as written by Bourges? I'm not completely sure what to make of this but amidst the wanderings were some profound tidbits. The story is framed as a dialogue between the Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, discussing the nature of the cities he's seen, which are all dimensions of Venice. My favorites: Valdrada (the city is reflected in every detail by the water in borders), Leandra (are the two species political or religious parties, or men and women?), Leonia (where people throw everything out and start with new stuff every day), and Trude (""The world is covered by a sole Trude which does not begin and does not end.

Phillip,"I didn't enjoy this novel as much as The Castle of Crossed Destinies, but I find what Calvino chooses to do with narrative as a form fascinating.This book is a series of short (1-3 pages) descriptions of cities, each with their own distinctive characteristics and identities, being told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Amidst the descriptions of the cities, Marco and Kublai discuss philosophical issues regarding language and signification, truth and fiction, reality, methods of knowing and understanding, and so on.While I would probably never want to read this again, it is a brilliant exercise in historiographic metafiction, philosophical literature, place-based writing, and postmodernism.",2013-05-31 10:56:06,4,en,2013-05-31 10:56:06,5,2013,0.00063,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,105

At other moments I got so caught up with the play of words, the both ethereal and magical description that I couldn't see the symbols and signs, just images that genuinely overwhelmed me. And I think that's what happens, Calvino captures the human mind in it's fluctuations between imagination and perception. The cities that are all moulded versions of the same thing speak for the power of imagination and the idea that we look for what it is we want to see, affected by memory, desire and our human condition.",2013-12-05 01:22:34,5,en,2013-12-05 01:22:34,12,2013,0.00062,0.00013,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,109
Anfenwick,"Invisible cities is a kind of bestiary of 55 cities in prose poetry, framed by conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. It’s plotless, tightly structured, not very long, and filled with beautiful words. It’s the sort of book that takes far longer to read than the time required to pass one’s eyes over the words. I can imagine fantasy writers using it as a sourcebook. I kept twisting it one way and another, trying to understand it what it meant if anything. The blurb on the back says ‘it gradually becomes clear that he (Polo) is actually describing one city: Venice‘.

Suffice to say that this was my second reading and I love the book more now that I did the first time.

Octavia Cade,"Lovely.One of my favourites, I've just finished rereading. What I like best about it - and what I'm most envious of, to be truthful - is the sheer weight of imagination in the pages. Each prose poem, each invisible city (including my own, the city of spider-webs) contains enough material to make an entire book in itself... and that book would be strange and beautiful and original.Calvino, though, takes these tiny miraculous things and puts them all together, because when you're a genius like he is you don't have to hoard your inspiration, you can just let it spill out and over because there's always more where that came from.

There is a garden in my mind.

Gary,"I had to reread Invisible Cities immediately to better appreciate the prose-poetry and structure. The voice is mysterious, philosophical , elegant and at times joyful and despairing. Are the form of cities based on Platonic forms that we are merely imitating and will eventually be exhausted? All cities seem more alike at ground level but from a distance they have distinctive differences. Calvino is also describing different types of human behavior that seems to be reaction to a particular city or maybe it's the other way around.

How the cities change according to their visitor and how the visitor changes his/her life course through every city he visits. The way Calvino presented the cities as crystal structures, whole networks of never-ending and always-changing interactions and symbols. Just like the neurons on the brain that form and reform for memories to exist and be retained. Just like memories can be created out of nothing. Memories that might be false but inherently true.

Each has some characteristic that animates it--a city with no center, a city that discards all its possessions every day, a city modeled on the stars.

Kelly,"This book is exquisitely written, and there are some really beautiful, evocative passages. However, it's very disjointed, more like a collection of poetry than a connected work.

I have less and less patience for this kind of writing as I get older. Frankly, I feel like this supposed treatise on the properties of cities was kind of a waste of beautiful writing.

That made it sound like a fairly dry exercise in sci-fi/fantasy world building, but that fortunately wasn't the whole story. It's really a set of vignettes meditating on very specific, often fleeting, aspects of human existence.

It's written incredibly poetically and while it brings up a tonne of ideas it's still abstract enough to make plenty of discoveries yourself.One of the few books I'm glad to say I couldn't fully digest, and possibly never will, as coming to it with a new lens and experiences will surely be a totally different adventure.",2017-01-11 04:03:10,4,en,2017-01-11 04:03:10,1,2017,0.00069,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,114
Elliot,"Unlike anything I've ever read before. Structurally ephemeral, Invisible Cities recounts Marco Polo's tales of exploration in conversation with Kublai Khan. He tells stories of seemingly countless unique settlements, wondrous and decadent, though they may in fact all be describing just one place. Maybe not even detailing one place, but the human mind itself, each city a slice of our own potential capacity for all experiences in life.

Brice Sewell,"Thesis RereadIn a garden, at dusk, in the capital of a decaying empire, a silent conversation occurs between an emperor, who seeks to truly possess all within his borders, and a traveler, who has journeyed beyond where foot and ship can take him. An exploration of the self, life, death, and the invisible threads that connect the three, Invisible Cities expands the limits of thought by a series of vignettes describing cities that simultaneously could never be and yet always exist beyond the horizon. In it, the path of the wanderer is intricately detailed without the protagonists ever taking a single step.",2018-06-23 06:26:48,5,en,2018-06-23 06:26:48,6,2018,0.00062,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,102
Balthasar Bustos,"Magnificent. Calvino at his very best. You can clearly see Borges' influence in these tales - the whole set-up is very much borgesian, with Marco Polo recounting his travels to emperor Kublai Kan. The way Calvino combines history with philosophy and fantasy is sublime. Every city is a great feat of imagination (he reminds me of Cortàzar at times, and even of Kafka); almost every city can be seen as an allegory with a deeper meaning. His prose is elegant and clean: there's never a word too much. At times it's more poetry than prose.My hat off to Calvino - one of the great post-war novelists.",2018-08-11 22:08:48,5,en,2018-08-11 22:08:48,8,2018,0.00115,0.0001,0.00018,0.00012,0.0002,0.00015,106
Lucas Moliné,"not a bad read tbh! i enjoyed it. i think you have to read it a certain way to grasp this novela's effect fully. i took a look at the table of contents and read the vignettes in order based on the number assigned in each section. it forced me to read each vignette one at a time instead of quickly flipping through the pages. and i think that's where a reader can find the beauty in calvino's work. all the cities have something unique to offer. i also decided to finish the conversations between Khlan and Polo last. i feel that a reader will feel more fulfilled if they read those consecutively. all in all, i loved reading this! i think more works by Calvino will be read in the near future.",2019-02-17 12:21:09,4,en,2019-02-17 12:21:09,2,2019,0.00076,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,133

Calvino does this not only through obvious means -- his style and descriptions, at once measured and flowing -- but also by dipping into metaphysics, magical realism, and human psychology. Readers may draw as much as they want from Invisible Cities; however, those willing to reflect upon and savor each of Calvino's short cityscapes will come away both wiser and more intoxicated than they would have been otherwise.

Tom Lee,"Calvino books are Calvino books. They're rewarding if approached in the right mindset. What distinguishes them is simply their framing, and this wasn't my favorite. Drained of verbs, these descriptions of cities reflect thinking that is often profound, though also sometimes banal (yes, suburbs often seem alike). There's a few too many setups involving superficial duality and an ensuing revelation of redemptive humanist imperfection. So: pretty good.

Sydney,"Kublai Khan sits down with young Marco Polo – one, as old and melancholy as his waning empire, the other young and filled with stories of his travels. These fantastical tales of fictional cities serve as a guide, on behalf of Marco Polo for the emperor, to traveling and to noticing, even when some situations make those things very, very difficult.

Jonathan,"I forgot how much I love Calvino. Haven't read him in years, but this is one of the most perfect ways to get back into him.

I caught glimpses of why this book is so loved, and even when understanding eluded me I enjoyed the literary sketches.

David Piwinski,"Not really a novel, more a collection of short prose pieces each describing a fictional city, as told by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. In between these stories, the two reflect on the nature of cities, of truth, and of life.This book is just incredible - you could open to any page and find a mini-masterpiece. Calvino's writing is stellar, and the cities he describes show an imagination that authors of fantasy can only dream of.

Ruben Gomez,"This is the first book by Calvino that I read and now I understand why he's so highly regarded. Reading the book's summary (descriptions of cities) I didn't know what to think and after reading it I'm still not sure what to make of it. Each city's description not only gives us a glimpse of Calvino's imagination but also of what a city can be and mean from different perspectives. It's an interesting framing device, an unexpected one and highly addictive.",2014-05-16 23:32:56,5,en,2014-05-16 23:32:56,5,2014,0.00057,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00017,0.00014,81
Emer Martin,I wanted to really love this as everyone I respect with regards to books absolutely raves about this one. I found it alluring but rather repetitive. Beautiful and mesmerizing. But I suppose I'm shallow and really want a story when I read a long work. This is a good book to read like a poetry book. Keep it above the bed and read a little of the wonderful writing and you'll be asleep in minutes.

Aumer,"An exquisite outpouring of sheer, unrestrained creativity. Absolutely phenomenal. Calvino's language and imagery is brilliant, and his philosophical interludes are fun and intellectually stimulating to boot. Previously, the most creative book I'd read was probably Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus, but Invisible Cities blows that out of the water entirely.

Eduardo Santiago,"Such a treat to read Calvino again! Especially interesting to read so closely after listening to Dan Carlin's podcast series on the Khans, although my newfound knowledge of the Mongol empire wasn't especially helpful for enjoying Calvino's quirkiness.Invisible Cities seemed more melancholic than Calvino's other works (as I remember them) but was still lovely and delightful.",2014-08-14 08:10:58,4,en,2014-08-14 08:10:58,8,2014,0.0007,0.00011,0.00017,0.00012,0.00018,0.00014,56

Rogue Reader,"Scheherazade and the thousand and one nights - not that Genghis Kahn would murder Marco Polo - just that Marco Polo's stories of these mysterious, half-imaginary cities keep the Kahn intrigued and engaged.

Rob,"I don't know why this took me almost six months to read. It's 200 pages.Very PoMo, no narrative to speak of. Beautiful prose. Mostly Marco Polo describing boatloads of cities to Kublai Khan. Individual cities' descriptions are quite short. A theme or themes do emerge, but as there's not a clear narrative thread, I didn't have a hook that made me want to pick it up and read more. I guess that's why it took six months.

Yifei Men,"Invisible Cities call to mind Paul Coelho's writing -- shadowed with mystique, powerful, haunting. The short book adopts perhaps the oldest story-telling form: a conversation between two men, but spins out a world so vibrant and throbbing with life.

Brandon Karcher,"I listened to this book while running. While it is poetic and eloquent, and I felt like I was put into a mild trance listening to the narrator say the word, ""cities"" over and over, I can't say I understood this book at all. But that's okay, because it was as pleasant as listening to atmospheric music, it got me through miles and miles of running, and it's another book down on my 100 book challenge.Thanks Italo!",2015-03-26 10:36:58,4,en,2015-03-26 10:36:58,3,2015,0.00071,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00014,77
Frances,"This falls into the category of ""books I am not smart enough to enjoy"". The cold harsh truth. It's a situation where I appreciated the prose and the imagery and I recognize that the writing was beautiful, but every time I finished a page I had to go back and re-read it because I just didn't retain anything.

Joshua,"A delicious meditation on travel, memory, cities, and identity presented as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan about the cities Marco Polo had been to in Kublai Khan's empire. It takes some unusual turns as it goes, especially in its descriptions of the actual conversation where Marco Polo and Kublai Khan wonder if they are real and the cities they discuss are imaginary or the other way around, and whether they are talking or imagining talking.",2015-07-18 10:05:14,5,en,2015-07-18 10:05:14,7,2015,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,78
Becky,"Invisible Cities isn't so much a novel as a collection of feelings about time and place. Not just the real places that Marco Polo describes on the journey taken by his father from Venice to the Empire of Kublai Khan, but the growth of modern metropoli and the effect these shapeless places have on the people who live in them. It's by turns beautiful and numbing, and the conversations between the two men are quite joyful.

Jonathan Bullock,"Extremely peculiar. Very intriguing idea, to imagine these sort of conversations. Imaginative and inspiring in the sense that it gives your mind vivid pictures of fantastic scale, then calls into question the limits of the scale as a whole.

Veronica Montejo,"Calvino posses a very interesting question as to the extent to which language can replace our other senses. At first when Marco can't speak Khan's language his narration is through gestures and objects, but when he learns the language Khan looses some of his fascination with the way in which Marco narrates his travels. The discourse becomes philosophical dialogue about what comprises a perfect city, a perfect empire.

Kevin,"My first reaction upon finishing is that I would like to read it again, but at a much slower pace. The structure of the book would lend itself well to a short daily reading and re-reading of a new chapter.

Lisa,"The value of this book lies in its use of imagery and philosophical thought rather than plot or action. Calvino presents more questions than answers about cities, perception and reality.

Marco Polo and Genghis Khan explore these questions in this short book.

Although the narrative and plot gluing together each tale it's excellent and very worthy of reading with delicate attention, individually each story is enough to be pondering on it and have a pause after each one. I, myself, made notes on each one. You feel the need to after finishing every single one.

I found this especially intriguing because Marco Polo's descriptions of the various cities in the book, while clearly metaphorical in scope exceeding cities alone, also do very often apply to contemporary urbanism and the quandaries facing planners and city dwellers.

Calvino's descriptions and the conversation framing them are filled with breathtaking moments of wisdom and beauty, written for easily parceled reading that fills the mind with clear-yet-hazy and at times surreal images of fantastic places.",2017-03-30 04:51:16,5,en,2017-03-30 04:51:16,3,2017,0.00068,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,129

Hannah Scanlon,"Masterfully written and artistically compiled, Calvino takes his reader through tiny vignettes of cities that Marco Polo imaginatively describes to the Emperor Kublai Khan. The question of whether these cities actually exist or whether Marco Polo has actually traveled to them is less important than the other questions that arise from their evocative descriptions: questions of justice, good and evil, human nature and its destiny are all hinted at. It amazed me how Calvino was able to describe so much with so little. Although a very brief book, the depth of its detail was profound; rich with perspective. It that it left me with the feeling that if I read it again tomorrow, the book would seem simultaneously familiar and new.",2017-08-13 08:58:03,4,en,2017-08-13 08:58:03,8,2017,0.00059,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00015,121

David,"A book almost impossible to classify. A novel (ostensibly) though without formal plot. A meditation upon Venice. A meditation upon the necessity of all lives containing and participating in a good-neutral-evil, a beautiful-nondescript-ugly triumvirate of forces. A work of pure imagination. The aging Kublai Khan, nowhere near Xanadu, listens to Marco Polo tell of the cities to which he has travelled. At one point, near the centre of the ‘narrative,’ when the Khan asks Polo why he has not yet mentioned Venice, Polo responds that all these cities are Venice—an interpretation expanded in loving detail by Jeanette Winterson’s review. It’s worth noting that this Marco Polo is familiar with airports as well as docks. There is nothing simple about the text. It is arranged in a strict mathematical pattern which progresses through nine chapters detailing eleven different types of cities. Yet in the middle of this labyrinth, the reader can lose sight of the governing pattern while not losing the spirit of the work. And, at the very end, for myself anyway, the closing lines are so satisfactory as a closing that I didn’t need to turn the next page to confirm that the final three or so leaves were blank: an excellent sense of an ending.",2018-05-24 05:05:29,0,en,2018-05-24 05:05:29,5,2018,0.00066,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015,207

Acj,"2.5 stars. This book was a gift and I wasn’t familiar with it or the author prior to diving in. My initial reaction was negative: it’s like a never-ending poem that is repetitive and seems without purpose, written for the writing rather than the content. The sections are so similar they blend together and I felt myself just reading to get through it. But I did find it grew on me as the book went on, and although I still feel it was better suited to a much shorter delivery method (a poem or even a short story: maybe Marco Polo describes 10 cities instead of 50), I can’t deny that it has some beautiful passages and some messages that really spoke to me. This is the kind of book that would be great to dissect in a university course. So 2.5 stars.

Violet wells,"...A five star review...I hate flying. The claustrophobia of it. So usually when I return to Italy after visiting London I catch the train to Paris and then the night train to Venice. That’s my little extravagance. I catch the night train to Venice and not Florence for one moment. The moment of walking out of the station of Santa Lucia and beholding the Grand Canal. I sit on the steps and let all the activity on the canal wash through me. I’m not sure why this moment means so much to me. It’s not a moment I can or even want to explain. I remember a line from a novel I read where a character gazing out at the Grand Canal says, “I keep wondering when all this will happen to me.” Perhaps that’s it, Venice articulates some deep desire we all have or evokes a memory of something that has never quite happened. Reading this for a second time is a bit like visiting Venice for a second time. A little bit of the magic fades but in compensation you notice lots of wonders you missed the first time. I read it in English this time. Now and again the writing seemed a bit clunky – “The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here.” That “if there is one” is a bit of an eyesore. But it’s no less clunky in Italian - L'inferno dei viventi non è qualcosa che sarà; se ce n'è uno – you can’t blame the translator for translating it word for word instead of trying to improve the fluency of Calvino’s prose. . This is probably the greatest book ever written about tourism, about the urge to escape the confines of where we live. Essentially Marco Polo is a tourist. And we all as tourists need an audience to show the images of our travels to. Kublai Khan is the audience, the vicarious tourist. He’s also a warlord, and by inference every warlord intent on conquering new territory is a tourist and every tourist is a warlord in embryo. We all want to conquer new lands. We’re all hungry for new discoveries, new exotic possessions. But we all eventually have to go home. Calvino is constantly making the point that every city is essentially what we bring to it. He’s brilliant at capturing the deep division of perspective between the tourist and long term inhabitant. Florentines are famous for never looking at the city’s monuments. It’s become how they distinguish themselves from the tourist. They turn a blind eye. They stare at their phones while walking across Piazza della Signoria. Venice has almost been turned into a romance theme park – it’s called upon to provide a standard collection of microwaved emotions as efficiently as an atm provides cash. One of the wonders of Venice now is the people who live there. You need them to understand something of the true nature of the city. To get behind the postcard façade. There are times when it’s much more rewarding to watch a man bump a barrow down the steps of a nondescript bridge than gaze blankly at the façade of San Marco. Sometimes it’s these kinds of details that bring a place alive for us. Calvino’s deployment of these telling details is probably this book’s most stellar achievement and what makes it such a joy to read. ...An alternative four star review... Calvino is one of the sacred cows of literature. He’s one of those writers who we’re tempted to pretend to like more than we really do, like Proust and Joyce, for fear of revealing some intellectual inadequacy. Interestingly for me, Virginia Woolf still isn’t one of these scared cows. When people don’t like Woolf they have more of a license to vent their scorn. It still hasn’t been officially recognised that Woolf is a great writer, by men at any rate. Often when there’s a list of the best novels ever written Woolf won’t feature at all, or if she does it’ll be her lesser but easier books like Mrs Dalloway or A Room of One's Own that makes the list. (To be fair her genius is recognised in Italy and France; it’s in the UK she tends to divide opinion.) So Invisible Cities vs The Waves. Invisible Cities is absolutely brilliant and inspired for the first fifty pages. But then it wanes a bit, gets a bit repetitive. Seems odd to say about a book of only 145 pages but might it have been better had it been a bit shorter? The contents page has the appearance of some mathematical formula, like a star map, so perhaps there’s some hidden genius in the design of this book. But if there is I didn’t get it and nor did anyone else judging by the few reviews I’ve read. It felt to me like the number of invisible cities we get was random and some were uninspired. If you took a single page out of The Waves it would collapse. You could take ten pages out of Invisible Cities without it being noticed. Also now and again Calvino is perhaps guilty of the kind of vacuous platitudes you’ll find strewn throughout the pages of The Alchemist. “Falsehood is never in words; it is in things.” That kind of thing. Looks great if you skim read it; becomes only a half-truth if you stop to think about it. So for me, The Waves wins over Invisible Cities in a heavyweight wrestling match. ...Back to tourism...Once upon a time the world was getting smaller. Now it’s getting bigger again as terrorism creates more and more no go areas. You could say terrorism is a war on tourism. It’s diminishing one of the biggest cultural phenomenon of our times. That’s probably the most significant change terrorism is making to the world. It’s making us think twice about travelling. I watched a heartbreaking report from Aleppo last night –a once magical town that none of us will ever see again. How long before it becomes one of Calvino’s Invisible Cities?",2016-09-14 19:08:08,5,en,2016-09-14 19:08:08,9,2016,0.00122,0.00011,0.0002,0.00011,0.00019,0.00016,1027
Riku Sayuj,"Invisible Cities; Imagined Lives
Marco Polo was a dreamer. He had great ambitions - wanting to be a traveller, a writer and a favored courtier. He wanted to live in the lap of luxury in his lifetime and in the best illustrated pages of history later. But he could only be a dreamer and never much more. Was it good enough? He never travelled anywhere and spent his life dreaming away in his Venice and is remembered to this day as the greatest explorer and travel writer of all time. How did that come about? It is a tale about the triumph of imagination over experience.In Venice, that city of water, a network of canals and a network of streets span and intersect each other. Marco Polo was traveling in a little boat in that Venice and thinking of the Marco Polo he was meant to be when his imagination began to soar. All the travelogues he wanted to write started coming to his mind. A whole book of descriptions, all made of poems that would describe the beauty of this city like those waves reflecting it in varied shapes among their ripples. He watched the people moving along the streets, each eye seeing the same city differently, dependent on the angle of observation, and speaking in a language of symbols and images that is more powerful than words can ever be. The river is the story, the river is the book, arranged in perfect sinusoidal waves of its own and choosing as its reader the greatest of all appreciators, the book catches the splendor of the city and reflects it for your patient eyes in a sort of primitive cubism, leaving it to you to make out all its meaning and all its poetry and to see ultimately yourself in that reflection of all the cities that imagination could possibly build.He started going on long voyages into his own mind, into the reflections of Venice, and into the reflections of those reflections. And then he wrote them down and he spoke of them and he sang of them. Men stopped to listen. They paid to hear him, first with time, then with gold, then with diamonds and great honors.The Venetian was soon summoned to the court of the great Kublai Khan, who was also a dreamer. He envisioned himself to be the greatest of rulers, his kingdom expanding and pouring over the whole vast world until all the world was under him. He knew that information was power and he wanted to know of every single city under him, and of every city that was to be under him. ‘On the day when I know all the cities,’ he thought, 'I shall be able to possess my empire, at last!’ He wanted Marco polo to be his eyes and ears and sent him off, with instructions to visit the most far flung and exotic provinces and to understand the soul of every city and to report back to him.Marco Polo bowed every time and with great aplomb set off for his great voyages. Next week he would be in his beloved Venice, dreaming up the world, a world more real than reality, with all the ingredients needed to construct a city - memories, desires, signs, skies, trade, eyes, sounds, shapes, names and the dead. He spoke of old cities with gods and demons in it, of cities yet to be, with airplanes and atomic bombs coloring their movements, and of cities that should have been, with happiness and sorrow apportioned in balance. What separates the dream’s reality from the dreamer’s reality? He pondered on this mystery with every city. Maybe all successful men dream our lives as it should be while rotting in some sewer and maybe all unhappy men dream their unhappiness in life while rotting in some palace? Maybe we can only continue our chosen destinies and everything else is a dream. It is only invisible cities we can construct. And we can reflect on them only through imagination, and fiction. He knew his cities were real.It took many years for the Great Khan to realize that Marco Polo wasn't describing cities so much as the human mind and experience. He realized that every city, whether imagined by Marco Polo or constructed by planned blueprints or grown from slow accretion are all dreams given shape by human hands, by human ambition, by a desire for a future that can be shaped. In fact, Marco Polo’s cities started to seem to him more real than any he knew to be real. He learned that if men and women began to live their ephemeral dreams, every phantom would become a city in which to begin a story of pursuits, pretenses, misunderstandings, clashes, oppressions, and the carousel of fantasies would stop.Khan now knew how to travel, to really travel. He could now accompany the great explorer in his prophetic journeys. He could describe cities to Marco Polo and he could listen to him, even as he filled in the details. They could sit together in the courtyard and be silent and still travel through the most exotic and most truthful of cities.Then came a day when Marco Polo had to inform the Khan, ‘<em>Sire, now I have told you about all the cities I know.</em>''<em>There is still one of which you never speak.</em>'Marco Polo bowed his head.'<em>Venice</em>,' the Khan said.Marco smiled. '<em>What else do you believe I have been talking to you about?</em>'The emperor did not turn a hair. '<em>And yet I have never heard you mention that name.</em>'And Polo said: '<em>Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.</em>''<em>When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them. And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.</em>' Khan made an attempt at looking angry but he knew his friend could see through faces and all such masks.'<em>To distinguish the other cities' qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice.</em> <em>For those who pass it without entering, the city is one thing; it is another for those who are trapped by it and never leave. There is the city where you arrive for the first time; and there is another city which you leave never to return. Each deserves a different name; perhaps I have already spoken of Venice under other names; perhaps I have spoken only of Venice.</em>’'<em>You should then describe for me Venice - as it is, all of it, not omitting anything you remember of it.</em>''<em>Memory's images, once they are fixed in words, are erased,</em>' Polo said. '<em>Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it. Or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little.</em>’Kublai looked at Polo. He understood. To tell a story you have to start from what you know best. You have to put your soul in the story and then build the flesh, the hair, the face and the clothes around it. The more stories you tell, the more of your soul you invest and lay bare to the world. When do you start fearing that you are as invisible as the cities you create? Kublai continued to look sadly at his friend.Kublai asks Marco, '<em>When you return to the West, will you repeat to your people the same tales you tell me?</em>''<em>I speak and speak,</em>' Marco says, '<em>but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear.</em>'Then Khan knew that the sadness he felt so pressingly as he tried to force the wine down was not for his dear friend but for himself, he now knew that as he was listening to all the stories that Marco Polo was describing to him, he was only hearing stories that he was telling himself. The cities were all real, but they were not reflections of Marco Polo’s soul, they were not reflecting his Venice. They were reflecting Kublai Khan’s own soul, his own empire, ambitions, desires and fears.Disclaimer: Marco Polo Really Did Go To China, MaybeEdit: I got a message from a goodreader asking me why I put up the whole story of the book without a spoiler warning...

Paul Bryant,"Marco Polo : Now I shall tell you of the beautiful city of Nottingham where the buildings are made mostly of blue glass, onyx and sausagemeat. The men of the city trade in fur, spices and photographs of each other with their respective spouses. All the men have large phalluses, sometimes so large they must cut pieces out of the tops of their front doors before they can exit their houses in the morning. This is a city of dreamers and anthropophagi, of astronomers and chess players, all with the largest of phalluses. The women of the city are the most voluptuous and lively. They wear clothes. Many times I have observed them gambolling and performing handsprings for sheer joy of being in Nottingham. The dogs of Nottingham are all sly and well-read.

Vit Babenco,"“In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea.” Samuel Taylor Coleridge – Kubla KhanThere are a countless number of cities but the most mysterious are those that we build in our imagination. Marco Polo arrives and he tells Kublai Khan about ghostly cities he visited during his journeys…
  Marco enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man’s place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in that square. By now, from that real or hypothetical past of his, he is excluded; he cannot stop; he must go on to another city, where another of his pasts awaits him, or something perhaps that had been a possible future of his and is now someone else’s present. Futures not achieved are only branches of the past: dead branches.
Cities are filled with memories: pleasant and sad… Cities are full of signs: explicit and obscure… Cities are laden with moods: exultant and nostalgic… Cities are packed with goods: necessary and trashy… Cities are fraught with the dead past and they brim with the alive present…
  “With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”

They come from the land of Marco Polo, or maybe not, may be from the land of Italo Calvino since I do not know if they are Venetians. Italy was a projection of the Imagination in the nineteenth century. Marco Polo did not know it.They carry a guidebook of the city of Madrid, and are trying to make sense out of the book, a book written in their language, and also make sense out of the city, written in the language of cities. Universally understood. Cosmopolitan.It must be the monuments, the streets, the histories, the nourishment, the inhabitants, the parks, the related but different language that they want to understand. They use the text and the reproduced images as the key to comprehend the Urbis and the originals standing in front of them.MemoryAnd may be one of them, the father, remembers when he came here with his parents. He could be telling his children now about his Memories. But as they are listening, they are also discarding those Memories and forming their own: new future Memories of having visited the city with their parents. And they will tell their future children who will also forget. Remembering a Forgetting, like waves of the same sea.DesireTheir visit must have been prompted by some Desire to leave their everyday monotonous but comfortable life and look for excitement. Depending on their age they could participate in the bustling Madrid night life in which Desires wildly run. Age and Desire. Are all of them captives of their Desire-Spectrums? Would I desire to unlock their Desires?No. Only mine.SignsLooking around these Italians could observe that most Signs only signal the same as all the others. International sign language has become a non-sign language. They mean sameness.Thin CitiesAs Europeans they should not be surprised to see that this is not a Thin City. There are trees, there are street lamps, and there are some dreadful tall buildings. It is a city that could grow horizontally because it is on a barren plateau. And yet,… and yet, it has steep roads. And these do feel like pure verticals on a tired morning. The city is hilly and the sharp drop comes as a surprise as one arrives at the Palacio Real, where the Sabatini Gardens extend deep down. Francisco Sabatini, another Italian and architect and who has projected an invisible Italian quality to this city. As if Marco Polo had been here.Trading CitiesWith no seaport it had to become a port of projections and become a matrix for the dispatches to far-away ports. And it did so contrary to Marco Polo’s direction when his route was blocked by the Tartars. This landlocked city would determine the launching of the black Galleons and sail them off cruising the sea-routes to meet the successors of Kublai Kahn and Trade with them in that twin trading city, Ma-Nila-Ma-Drid. Coming and going. EyesThere is a building where there are many Eyes. They are all moving and roving around, looking at the walls, at the colours and flat shapes on the walls. And they continue looking and those walls with their images look back at them. The paintings have been looking at eyes for a longer time than these eyes have looked at anything. And there thrones a picture with which the imagination of a Venetian captured the Warrior on horseback looking over those eyes, looking without seeing them. Echoing the other Emperor when he had said to his Venetian: “describe to me your cities”, Emperor Charles V summoned Tiziano Vecellio and said to him “paint me your worlds, so that I can see them”.Tiziano painted Charles’ gaze into the horizon, into his world.NamesMatrix, or Matrice or Matriz or Magerit or Magra. The same city, different identities and varying names. Madrid in Spanish, Madrid in English, Madrid in German.And 马德里 in Mandarin, Ma-de-li, for the understanding of Kublai Kahn.The DeadThe monuments make the Dead more alive that the current alive. They remain and there are very many. But since I have a Now, I am interested in the fewer ones.The SkyIt is not true that Madrid has no sea. It just hangs over its inhabitants. The very intense blue of the Sky, so deep an azure because of the dry climate and the elevation of the city, makes one imagine oneself with wings which can be spread out to then set off with one’s soul and swim in the airy ocean.The Ultra-Mar.ContinuousNight and day, and Seasons. And clocks, many clocks. They seem to divide time, but they are phantasmagorias or devices that do the opposite from the magic emerging out of Phenakistoscopes and create the illusion of discrete, detached, distinct moments out of the unceasing Continuous.HiddenMost of the inhabitants are also tourists, like this Italian family. This is a city populated not just by passers in Life, but principally by outsiders who were not born here. Anonymous origins and undisclosed length of time for their open transit. Whether in hotels or temporary homes everybody’s lives remain invisible from each other. And their realities are not deciphered in the guide book of the Italians, just as Marco Polo did not succeed in deciphering his cities for the Great Kahn. They will remain invisible.Great ChanInvisible Cities forms part of the conclusion of Jonathan’s Spence’s The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds. After reviewing the representation of China in Western minds, starting with Marco Polo, Spence tackles in the final chapter the three geniuses who understood what was at stake. Neither Kafka, nor Borges nor Calvino, had ever been to China. Yet, to the Sinologist Spence, they were the three bright minds who did not fall on the Orientalist trappings. And Calvino was the one to have identified best the trappings of the mind in representing the fascinating unknown.",2012-04-02 20:27:11,5,en,2012-04-02 20:27:11,4,2012,0.00081,0.00011,0.00017,0.00011,0.00018,0.00016,1027
Cecily,"The photo is of new and old Shanghai, photographed by Greg Girard in 2000 (source), chronologically equidistant between my two visits there. It is, and maybe always has been, a city of contrasting, unequal, parts and pairs, like many of the Invisible Cities.“Each man bears in his mind a city made only of differences.”ListenI’ve been eavesdropping on the mysterious, hypnotic conversations between a famous explorer from antiquity and the powerful emperor of a distant land: Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Exotic places are conjured by gestures, emblems, and words. Then the tables turn, and the Khan describes the cities of his dreams and asks Polo if they exist.But is it the 55 cities bearing female names, or many aspects of a single city (Venice), or nearer a hundred cities (many of them have twins or doubles)? Submit to EnchantmentIt’s deliciously slippery collection of prose poems about places, grouped by words and numbers, repeated in different permutations that defy a single interpretation (though many have been applied, including sine waves). It suggests multiple routes of reading, much like some of the twisted and recursive paths through the cities themselves. There are Cities and Memory, Cities and Desire, Cities and Signs, Thin Cities, Trading Cities, Cities and Eyes, Cities and Names, Cities and the Dead, Cities and the Sky, Continuous Cities, and Hidden Cities.It purports to be about physical places, but as it explores “the invisible order that sustains cities”, there are twists and forks in time as well as geography: “the city toward which my journey tends is discontinuous in space and time”.I fear that if I try to constrain these kaleidoscopic and sometimes paradoxical visions to black and white marks on a screen, I will somehow kill the enchantment – for myself as well as for anyone reading. DoThese are places you must experience for yourself, walking the streets; crossing the canals; peering in windows; holding your nose at the stench; marvelling at the architecture; gazing at the underclad bathing beauties; exploring the exotic markets; puzzling at the frequent mentions of pipes, taps, gutters, and sewers; choking on smoke, and always seeking fresh revelations. As you wander, you can wonder how the cities are simultaneously similar and yet startlingly different: it’s never clear quite what real and what is not, what is cause and what is effect. Perhaps that’s part of the invisibility of the title.Whether this is travelling through China, Calvino, Venice or an atlas in a library, your journey will not be the same as mine, and nor will my subsequent ones. We will not be the same people, either. Meanwhile, in another city, another Cecily is writing a completely different review…Related Books•	This was my second Calvino.

Leonard Gaya,"After travelling to the Far East for more than twenty years, Marco Polo sailed back to his Venice hometown and, upon arriving, was taken prisoner by the invading army of Genoa. And so his journey ended at the bottom of a cell. As a precursor of captive writers such as Cervantes or Dostoyevsky, Marco Polo then went on to write a large book about his travels: the Livre des merveilles du monde (Book of the Marvels of the World, ca. 1300 AD).To us, 21st-century fast-paced tourists and business travellers (except when a global pandemic strikes!), the world is a monotonous place. You can probably eat the same tasteless McDonalds burger everywhere you go. But, to a man of the 13th century, who usually would never in his whole life have gone further away from home than the next town, you would think that travelling to the other end of the world would have been a dazzling experience! In a way, you would be wrong… What came to the older Marco Polo’s memory from his journey to China did not feel quite marvellous enough, and he went on to embellish his tale with fantastical embroideries… To such an extent that, when leafing through his book, you would hardly be able to believe that he actually went there. More than half a millennia later, Italo Calvino, Marco Polo’s distant countryman, decided to elaborate further on the Livre des Merveilles’ shimmering and misleading pictures of the world. Invisible Cities (1972) is a book in the form of a dialogue between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo: the former, overwhelmed by the vastness of his Mongol Empire — which, at the time, extended from the Baltic Sea to Japan and Vietnam —, asks the Italian traveller to describe the cities he has visited during his voyage before reaching the court of Xanadu. So Marco Polo, as we have seen, concocts exotic and outlandish descriptions of cities he has never seen: literally, invisible cities. Justifiably, the great Khan asks Marco Polo in Calvino’s book: “I do not know when you have had time to visit all the countries you describe to me. It seems to me you have never moved from this garden”.Invisible Cities is like a medieval bestiary or herbarium: a fanciful list of everything that God has (or ought to have) created under a specific category. There are fifty-five-women-name-bearing cities catalogued in Calvino’s book, arranged into a fastidious series of themes (typical of mid-20th-century formal music and French literature). Each vignette is very short — about a couple of pages long at most. However, all are incredibly evocative and intriguing, like pictures out of the nightmare of an urbanist. Some cities, just as actual cities, are just made of dreams, desires and fears, others of lost memory, of opposing deserts or opposing gods, of stage roles, of endless repetitions, of conceptual differences, of moving parts, of pure verticality, upward or upside down, of thousands of identical faces, of boundless wastelands, inexhaustible dumps, untold graves, bottomless latrines, countless stars.All in all, each dense and intricate description of a fantastical city is, in and of itself, as the seed of a more significant novel (say, like Reeve’s Mortal Engines?). Each page is a barely veiled evocation of Jorge Luis Borges’ short stories and M. C. Escher’s drawings. The wonderful Cités obscures graphic novels by Schuiten and Peeters, published a few years later, also come to mind. All are indeed highly cerebral authors.",2019-05-16 02:02:09,4,en,2019-05-16 02:02:09,5,2019,0.00127,0.00011,0.0002,0.00012,0.00021,0.00017,576
Gaurav,"It's easy to describe what 'Invisible Cities' is not rather than what it is as it's really very difficult to ascertain which category it can be put into; it neither has a clear plot nor characters are developed as they normally are, it can't be called a novel or collection of stories, can't be put in any one genre since it surpasses so many; but still something extraordinary, something which can't be described in words, which can only be felt. The book has loose dialogues between emperor- Kublai Khan and a Venetian explorer-Marco Polo, Polo is ordered to explore the empire of the Khan and to tell parables with which to regale the ageing, and frequently impatient conqueror with descriptions of every city he has visited on his long peregrinations through Kingdom of Kublai Khan.The parables are surreal in nature and prose is very lyrical however I wonder how lyrical it would be in its original language. The book is divided into parables about fifty five imaginary cities which are categorized into eleven groups of memory, desire, sign, thin, trading, eyes, names, dead, sky, continuous and hidden.Different groups are associated with different themes, as Cities &amp; Memory stories are philosophical thought experiments about nostalgia, history; discarding old Memories which are formed through word of mouth and forming their own.-""As this wave from memories flows in, the city soaks it up like a sponge and expands.""-""The city which cannot be expunged from the mind is like an armature, a honeycomb in whose cells each of us can place the things he wants to remember....""At this point I feel It's not possible to review the book though I made a futile attempt; and the more I think about the book the more I feel I have to re-read it and then read it again.However there is one thing which I can surely say about 'Invisible Cities'that it's 'A lucid dream: one which can be experienced and can't be described'.",2015-06-16 05:35:56,5,en,2015-06-16 05:35:56,6,2015,0.00071,0.00012,0.00018,0.00012,0.00017,0.00014,327
